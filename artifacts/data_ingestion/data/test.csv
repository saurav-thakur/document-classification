"Subject: RR Interoffice Memorandum Invention Disclosure: Date: July 25, 1986 Friction Heat Source within a Cigarette Type Structure RE: Project Beta Gus Borschke From: D. L. Potter A. E. Westmoreland Nicotine is considered a significant source of flavor per- ception in a cigarette. It is well known that flavor and nico- tine delivery can be significantly enhanced in a non combustion cigarette type product if a heat source can be applied to the nicotine and flavor containing tobacco or compartment of the product. Devices have been disclosed in the patent literature which discuss several methods of providing a heat source without combusting the tobacco. [See (PCT) WO 86102528 (9.5.86)] In this patent, methods suggested to provide a non combusting heat include: An electric battery connected to a heating coil. A gas burner device. © Liquids which produce heat when mixed. This disclosure presents an alternate means of producing the desired heat through the force of mechanical manipulation by the user to produce friction heat. Within the shape of a cigarette rod there are several forms of friction which can be incorporated. Three of these are listed here with illustration but they are not intended to limit the scope of this disclosure. 1, Friction Induced Through Flexing a Material: In this design, a material is placed inside the rod structure that when repeatedly flexed will produce heat through the molecu- lar friction within its structure. This is much the same as a wire becoming hot when repeatedly bent back and forth to break the wire. The material may be a metal, bimetal, spe- cialized polymer plastic or other suitable material. ‘A memory should be incorporated into the design to return the rod shape to a straight form during and after flexing. This may be incorporated into the rod structure, as a separate material within the rod or as a part of the friction material, 1608 zezts",0

"What happens when cigarette smokers give up the habit? Do their chances of dying of pulmonary and cardiac diseases decrease? Do they lose various physical complaints? Evidence on these points is presented in this report, and the evidence indicates that those who stop have a more favorable future, and the longer they stop the better the outlook. EVIDENCE ON THE EFFECTS OF GIVING UP CIGARETTE SMOKING E.Cuyler Hammond, SeD,, FAPIHA. EDENcE on the eles of ving wp smoking is more dificult to obtain than one might suppose. We must first inquire why some habitual smokers give up the habit and whether, once having stopped smoking, they are likely to re: sume the habit at a later date. In a mail survey conducted in 1958, wwe asked excigarette smokers why they hhad stopped and whether they thought ving up the habit had any effect on their health or the way they felt ‘About 60 per cent said that they had stopped because of some physical com- plaint such as cough, chest or throat complaints, loss of appetite, stomach trouble, or circulatory difficulties. Eighty- two per cent of those who ssid that they had stopped because of a physical com: plaint indicated some improvement (such as less coughing) as an apparent result of giving up the habit. Seventy: four per cent of the men said that they gained weight. Table 1 shows the reasons for giving up smoking as stated by a sample of men between the ages of 50 and 69 who filled out questionnaires in late 1959 and early 1960. All of these men 602 had a history of only cigarette smoking and had stopped less than a year prior to answering the questionnaire. About 17 per cent of them were “sick at pres: * Over half of those who were sick that they quit smoking because of some illness oF physical complaint and over three-quarters of those who were not “sick at present” gave the same sort of reasons. The most frequently stated reasons were “doctor's orders,” heart and circulatory diseases, and pul monary complaints such as cough, fu, sinus trouble, and other respiratory con- ditions. ‘Two years after enrollment in a pro- spective epidemiological study, surviving subjects were requested to fill out a second questionnaire? They were asked whether they had been hospitalized and whether they had any serious diseases Since enrolling in the study. They were ‘also asked how many cigarettes they currently smoked per day. ‘The data shown in Table 2 are con- fined to male subjects between the ages ‘of 50 and 69 who were smoking ciga rettes regularly when enrolled in the study.

Villegas SUBJECT: Packaping Materials DATE: April 15, 1986 Two package designs are currently under evaluation for the final SPA package. The artuork mechanicals for the first design were received fron marketing in mid-February. Que to the events outlined in the attached meno, RJR Archer cannot promise delivery of materials before June § (printed overurap will be delivered by mid-May), Marketing is scheduled to make the final package recommendation on June 2. This will not pive us adequate time to evaluate the materials on the G D packer and make modifications to the machine and/or materiel to optimize the package. In other words, we will be forced to go with what we have at the time. We realize some of the delays are e result of this being a “first time"" order. The ground work layed by the first request helped facilitate the second design materiel order which required only ten days for completion. The following steps should help with future orders **Communication with marketing before the design is requested. The overurap required for the Alpha package contains a layer of foil which makes the back ground color (in this case cream) take on @ grey tint. Some compensation has been made in correcting this effect, but perhaps @ different color would have been selected if the designers-had been ausre of the oreying effect of the foil. ‘#Artuork should not be given to the materials supplier until it is camera ready. Several changes (such as removing the uord ""box"", moving the location of the warning label, and changing the width of the tear tape line) were made by the design department (reluctantly because they consider a designer's art~ work sacred) and by marketing and the packaging group. In the future, artuork will not be accepted until the design has been corrected on the layouts by the designer. seMeetings which involve changes of or decisions about packaging materials need representation from the SPA packaging group and purchasing depertment. Because the SPA package differs from conventional packaging, this could prevent problems with machinability and materials. A meeting will be scheduled prior to the final desion request to discuss other considerations for the final package (embossed or non-embossed inner liner, color of the inner. frame, carton design) which are a marketing decision but impact the work of the packaging group.

BRANDS DEVELOPMENT WINSTON Lights 65 Pilot Plant test write-ups were turned in this week for the RSM Designed PGT Study due to mail out 02/19/90. The design is a hexagonal with replicated midpoints to maximize utilization of the information gathered. Variables are (1) Reconstituted Sheet inclusion (at 6 levels) and (2) Puffed Tobacco inclusion (at 3 levels). The base blend is current WINSTON Lights 85 at a higher density than current. Previous learning suggested that the blend moisture level remain at current levels (12.75%). Products will be made the week of 02/05/90. Results are due 04/02/90. ur 8 Two R&D Confirmation products were made last week in the Pilot Plant and will be mailed to NFO the week of 01/15/90. Both of these prototypes met the short term action standard of parity acceptance to current WKS and parity puff count to Marlboro ks. one product is from a compilation of Full Flavor learning fron \ previous testing, primarily 1988 and 1989 development with HSB st information as a'base. It is a higher nicotine product with no é casing or top dressing and, combined with a lower moisture, y delivers ideal strength and tobacco taste. The second product “\ utilizes a new ammoniation process (on the reconstituted sheet portion) by application of DAP (diammonium phosphate)’ with the Current blend as a base. (The ammoniation currently in the flue- cured portion has been removed). Both of the above candidates are higher density products with lower puffed tobacco inclusion rate. Additionally, both utilize Hystar which is superior to glycerin in humectancy activity, and they use woodpulp cigarette paper with improved whiteness and brightness over currently used flax paper. f€€L T90Ts",0

As a result, the president of Brain- Reserve has kept a fairly low profile for nine years. No more."" Her struggle between carefully cultivated ‘anonymity seems finally to be at an end, For example, lately she has been publicly predicting the fu ture, which tends to draw at- tention to a person. ‘And telling The CocaCola Co, that its marketing strategy is all wrong — as Popcorn also hhas done, strictly uninvited — {is no way to be inconspicuous, Her wardrobe.

There were Stresstabs vita: mins, Kool cigarettes, Ultra Brite toothpaste, Spanada wine, Arpege perfume and a hhost of others, as BrainReserve built up its “positioning” fran: chise. All of which is great, except that, by Popcorn’s reckoning. the franchise is vanishing, “Positioning is a dead word,’ she says. “It's finished. No longer will manufactur: ers be able to define their own markets simply by the way they package and advertise their products, she says. “The consumer is king. They went through two recessions They didn't have cash and products failed them. They were burned, and when they learn through burn they don’t forget.” These, she says. are the days — one who demands intelli: gent, high-quality products and advertising that gives real in- formation about what the prod- uct does, For example, she says, Coca: Cola will find tnat consumers will greet a jingle like ""Coke is it! with “Coke is what?” Kellogg Co.. she says ‘should get to the point: Cora Flakes is a healthy and nutri tous breakfast.” And so on.

"N Localization of a new ferritin heavy chain sequence present in human brain mRNA to chromosome 11 5981 ‘Two types of ferritin heavy (H) chain clones have been isolated from cDNA libraries of ‘human fetal and adult brain: one corresponds to the ferritin H chain mRNA that is abundant in liver and is called “liverlike” brain cDNA; the other contains an additional 279 nucleotide (nt) sequence in the 3'untransleted region and is called brain ferritin H chain CDNA, To map the 279-nt sequence, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification was carried out using DNA from rodent X human hybrid cell lines containing single human chromosomes as templates, and oligomeric primers homologous to the 3‘end of the 279-nt sequence (primer A) and to a coding sequence just 5"" to the 279-nt sequence. Significant PCR product of the size expected from analysis of the brain ferritin H chain eDNA clones and a genomic ferritin 1} chain clone (487 bp) ‘was generated only from hybrid-cell DNA containing human chromosome 11.

While certain con ponents of the immune system are depressed, others are enhanced. In particular, fn increased proportion of T lymphocytes which bear Fe receptors for IgG has, been noted in older individuals (3, 4). Natural killer (NK) cells, which are Fe receptor positive lymphocytes, are believed to play a role in immunosurveillance: viral infection, and hemopoietic regulation (S, 6). In view of the higher incidence of tumors in aged humans, attempts have been made to evaluate any possible correlation between the basal NK activity and age. Also, a central question among previous (7~10) and present investigators is whether # relationship exists between human survival and the NK component of the immune system and. if so, could NK activity be a determinant for longevity?

"September 9, 1982 To: Mr. E. J. Fackelman FROM: K. V. McCaffrey RE: Project AA With regards to your memo of September 2, let me say that while I don't disagree with the premise that imagery concepts are the most difficult to develop and refine on the down side, I do feel that the upside of Project AA has been completely overlooked. 1. To put it in your words, I view Project AA as being ""corrective"" imagery and not ""compatible"" imagery. If the designer name was Calvin Klein then I would say that AA is in a ""compatible"" image mode. However, Yves Saint Laurant is a high fashion Paris designer who is viewed as having distinctive sophisticated products which young adult female smokers want to be able to afford in their later years but cannot attain at this time. ‘The strength that I see in Project AA is a distinctive product coupled with a reinforcing image that could generate a very positive appeal. This premise is based on women's return to femininity. But I don't mean femininity in the traditional sense. Today's femininity includes not only physical attractiveness but also includes intelligence, independence, self-confidence and the ability to successfully lead a full, rich life. The sexual . revolution is not part of today's 18-24 year old woman. They assume that all avenues of opportunity are open to them but they want to project themselves as attractive women not neuter gender. 2. Project AA's main benefit to its target group is a cigarette that has a distinctively subtle taste (not overpowering) that is better than other brands on the market today. The reason or support for why this cigarette is better is due to the designer name influence. This influence causes expectations of a distinctive product that must be provided or consumers will feel they have been mislead. (As information, a formal positioning statement will be issued the week of September 13.) However, the bottom line is a subtly distinctive product with a subtly distinctive image carrier. 3. While it was known from the beginning that the odds of finding a solution to the 18-24 year old Corporate gap were minimal, Executive Management felt that at least we might gain some usable consumer information. Therefore, a rather rapid schedule was devised to not waste efforts if a solution did not appear quickly. znee LnZ0S",0

The epithelium of the conductive airways are frequently target of toxic chemical and microblal agents causing inflammation, hypersecretion anc epithelial necrosis. There is increasing evidence thet the epithelium itself plays an active role in this process by secreting a variety of peptide and li mediators of inflammation. TNF-a is a prototypical inflammatory cytokine released by macrophages and other inflammatory calis| The purpose of this studies was to determine the effects of TNF-a on fully differentiated rat trachea! epithelial (RTE) cells in culture. We examined 1) whether RTE cells express TNF-« receptors, 2) whether exposure to TNF-a causes cytotoxicity 3) whether TNF-a induces TNF-a expression and 4) whether it activates the arachidonic acid cascade and §) whether TNF-a exposure affects production and secretion of mucus. We found that RTE cell cultures express TNF-c. receptor CD120a and b transcripts and CD120a protein. ‘Treatment of the cultures with TNF-« (500 U/ml, 24 hrs) significantly reduced CD120a levels but was nontoxic as determined by LDH release. RTE calls expressed low levels of TNF-« message a5 determined by RT-PCR which appeared to be elevated after TNF-« treatment.

"Toxicity of Aerosols Introduction [x recent seams there has been a growing concern about the toxicity of aerosol products that are sold for medicinal, per- sonal, or houschold use. The most serious ineidents have been death from the in- halation of acrosol for household use that is collected in a plastic bag, @ dangerous practice which clearly constitutes a mis- use of the product, There is no question that the fatal outcome of this habit is re- lated to the inhalation of acrosol propel- ants that are known to be toxic to the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. The potential hazards of aerosols con- taining bronchodilator drugs are diffieult to assess. ‘The therapeutic value of the rug can readily be measured, but the toxicity of the propellants is uncertain, ‘The available information indicates that in animals the inhalation of high eon- centrations of propellants may eause fatal ceardiae arrhythmias, ‘The animals used in these studies do not suffer from broncho- spasm, so that there is a possibility that the presenee of bronchopulmonary dis- case might inerease the sensitivity of the heart to lower concentrations of the pro- pellants.

The concentration of the pro- pellant that is inhaled is lower than that ‘of bronchodilators, because of its dilution by mixture with room air. However, one aerosol product for medication of the room was reported to have caused 21 deaths, and it has been withdrawn from the market, presumably because of the toxicity of the propellant. ‘The remaining group of aerosols for personal use, consisting of hairsprays, Acodorants, and feminine hygiene prod- ets, present a different form of hazard. ‘These are not introduced directly into the air passages but are sprayed on vari- ous parts of the body. The propellants generated from the acrosols for personal use are inhaled at a lower concentra than the other acrosol produets. How. ever, the personal produets are used more frequently than the others There is no adequate information on the toxicity aris- 1g from chronic use of these propellants, This article is intended to review the present state of knowledge on the toxicity of acrosol products.

"“SUBJECT: WINSTON Drag Racing - Opportunities Recently, I had an opportunity to view a drag racing event in Rockingham. The concentration and impact of our overall identifi-~ cation and the young adult male orientation of this growing sport are factors which make this a unique activity. As we move toward our planning for next year, the following observa~ tions should be note: 1, Improvements are needed in two key areas relating to sampling and promotional products: (a) The unique, open accessibility and spectator traffic flow make sampling more difficult, (b) The strong orientation of this group to t-shirts and the active merchandising by the various racing sponsor/concessionaires places our Promotional Products Group approach at a competitive disadvantage. Recommendation/Action Program Discussions with R. Powell and J. Byrd have generated a variety of ideas for testing to address current needs. The focal point of the test effort would be a tent and activity area which would serve as a sampling distribution point, a display area estab- lishing brand sponsorship to smokers, and a opportunity for broader, more aggressive merchandising of our Promotional Pro- ducts Group items. In effect, a grouping of current low level activities into a more concentrated area, positioned to maximize traffic flow, would heighten our brand presence -at the event. (This is not too unlike the VANTAGE PGA tent which is designed for a similar sampling objective.) Proposed testing of this activity area, accompanied by other Proven volune oriented and consumer involvement activities, will help provide a much needed promotional focus to drag racing. It [, is proposed that the test of this program would be scheduled for hye Labor Day weekend at Indianapolis. Funding would be provided by Promotion/Promotional Products Group test dollars with ultimate funding for this effort from Sampling and Promotional Products eeu’ Group budgets. we 2£92 éL90s",0

Pacey ewe 0884 Lone Come, Autopsy findings link women’s lung cancer rise to alert diagnosis WASHINGTON—Three Yale epidemiologists suggest that ‘women's higher incidence of lung cancer today may be more a reflection of physicians’ diligence in diagnosing it among women who smoke than of the increase in the number of female smokers. But a pulmonary specialist describes their hypothesis as “convoluted reasoning.” ‘The investigators base their theory on the “surprise discovery."" ina 10%-year autopsy review, of nearly equal numbers of men and women with undiagnosed primary Jung cancer. All 3286 autopsies performed on adult patients at Yale-New Haven Hospital between Septem: ber 1971 and May 1982 were included in the study. Dr. Michael J. McFarlane, a Robert Wood Johnson postdoctoral fellow, presented his group's findings at the meeting here of the Association of American Physicians, the American Society for Clinical Investigation, and the American Federation for Clinical Research, ‘Small sample. Acknowledging thatthe sample size was too small for the findings to achieve statistical signifi- cance, Dr. McFarlane—speaking also for co-investigators Drs. Alvan R. Feinstein and Carolyn K. Wells—said, “We ‘elieve that some ofthe recently feported increase in hung. cancer in women may be due to increased detection and that the increased detection may be enhanced by the in- creased number of women who smoke.” Primary lung cancer was found in 152 patients at au- topss, including 108 whose cancers were diagnosed dur- ing life and 43 whose tumors went undetected. Of those with diagnosed lung cancer, 77 were men and 32 were ‘women aratio consistent with the expected hung cancer incidence differential between men and women. Of those with previously undiagnosed hung cancer, 24 were men— for a lung cancer rate of 14.3 per 1,000—and 19 were swomen-—for a rate of 12.7 per 1,000. Of the 43 unexpected auropey reculte, 27 concerned patients who had never had a cancer diagnosis and 16 con ‘cerned cancer patients with unknown or incorrectly iden: tified primary sites. “Our findings clearly contrast the reported rates of hing cancer diagnosed in men and ‘women during life. We can assume that a great deal of lung cancer goes undetected among the general popula. tion, especially among women,” Dr. McFarlane said MEDICAL WORLD NEWSVune 11, 1984 T10447-0795",9

"Corner on Research The Health Realization Approach to Resiliency By BONNIE BENARD Far West Laboratory for Educational RED In his chronicle of the lives of people struggling during the Great Depression, Let Us Now Praise Fa- rus Men, james Agee wrote: ""In every child who is born, under no matter what circumstances, and no matter what parents, the potentiality of the human race is born again.” No words better summarize the belief system inherent in the resiliency paradigm. It is a belief system that manifests itself in the follow- ing words to a child or youth: “You can be who you ‘want to be; you can achieve your dream: I believe in, 7°. Tpese words communicate that powerful protec: tive factor, high expectations, which the child then internalizes as self-efficacy. The result is not only motivation but a sense of purpose and bright fu- ture—enother attsbute of the resilient person. How- ‘ever, many youth hear the opposite message in their famlies, schools, or communities: “You're not good enough: your family’s ‘at risk’; your sex, race, cul- ture, or ethnicity are not good enough: you'll never amount to anything,” These negative words create interralized thoughts of impotence, such as: “I'm ‘not good enough there’s no reason to try; things will never change’”—words reflecting not only loss of motivation but loss of Unforuinately, the number of youth growing up ‘with no sense of a bright future is increasing at an. alarming rate. As one journalist states: “Youthful ‘America’s vision of its own future has never been more dire, particularly in the cities, As one 17-year- old African American put it on his way into court ‘T been dead since Iwas 12, s0 I'm not afraid of dying, T'm just waiting to get kicked into the grave’ ” (Vo gel, 1994). I'd lke to share with you an approach that has demonstrated effectiveness at facilitating the devel- opment within youths or adults of the belief that they are innately resilient—that they have the cape ity to develop caring relationships, to solve their ‘own problems, to feel good about who they are, and tobe optimistic about their future. While I've writ- ten previously about the Health Realization model developed by Roger Mills (see Benard and Lorio, 1991; Linquant, 1992), Tam continually impressed by the growing number of practitioners—in the From Wester Center News, December 1994, Vol.8, No. 1 fields of addiction, education, community organiza- tion, community policing, organizational develop- ment, therapy, and counseling —using this approach across the country in schools, community-based 0 {gonizations, housing projects, treatment centers, hes- Pitals, businesses, and communitywide collabora- ions. I'd like to discuss Health Realization as applied resiliency, that is, how this approach integrates and iMustrates our resiliency model, which is grounded in developing environments rich inthe protective factors of caring, high expectations, and opporturi- ties for participation in order to foster the individual traits of resilience: social competence, problem-solv- ing, autonomy, and sense of Bright future. Finally, ‘welll discuss what the Health Realization approach offers the field of prevention and early intervention. ‘The Health Realization approach evolved from the application of the principles of a new wellness paradigm in psychology, Psychology of Mind, to the prevention, early intervention, and community de- ‘velopment arenas. Health Realization began in the late 1980s with a demonstration project in a Dade County, Florida, housing project beset with the ef- fects of poverty and racism: violence, drug-dealing, domestic violence, teen 7 and school fail- ure. Today, Health Realization is demonstrating its effectiveness not only in dramatically reducing the rates ofall these problems but also in building a serise of community pride and well-being in commu- nities across the nation. Some of the findings from pre-and juations of the 142 families and 604 ‘youth involved in the three-year Dade County pro- ject include significantly improved parent-child rela- tionships in 87 percent of the families, a75 percent reduction in delinquency and school-related prob- Jem behaviors, a 65 percent decrease in drug traffick- ing, an 80 percent decrease in teen pregnancy, and a 60 percent decrease in substance abuse. Recent find- ings from the one-and-a-half year Coliseum Gardens Project in Oakland, California, include a cessation of all gang warfare and ethnic clashes between the ‘Cambodian and African American youth, 45 per- cent reduction in violent crimes (and no homicides since the project began), and a 110 percent increase in youth involvement in the Boys and Girls Club.

Steele From: Tory Payne Objective: To investigate the relationship between mutagenicity and weight of tobacco burned, tar, cigarette length, and air dilution for RJR products. Summary: Mutagenicity estimates using a nonlinear regression model were obtained on a sample of 24 RJR products, Correlations between mutagenicity (estimated from linear and nonlinear regression models) and weight of tobacco burned, tar, cigarette length and air dilution were determined. Preliminary regression analyses were performed to investigate the relationship of the above-mentioned variables to mutagenicity. Conclusions: Tar and air dilution were the best single predictors of mutagenicity on a revertants/mg tar basis. Tar was the best single predictor for mutagenicity on a revertants/cigarette basis, followed by weight of tobacco burned. Various combinations of weight, length, tar and air dilution predicted mutagenicity better than any variable by itself. However, variables other than these influence mutagenicity since the percent of variability explained ranged from only 48% to 82%. 8 3 2",0

"RR Interoffice Memorandum: ._ | Subject: Control of Tobacco Nitrates Date: october 29, 1982 and Nitrosamines To: Dr. G. R. Di Marco From: charles Green Recent papers and discussions at the 36th Tobacco Chemists' Research Conference have reemphasized the attention being given by anti-smoking forces to the role that nitrosamines may play in alleged health problems caused by tobacco product usage. Tobacco scientists have demonstrated that both volative and tobacco specific nitrosamines are related to the nitrate levels in the tobacco. In-house studies have shown that the main sources of nitrates in our products are burley tobacco, burley stems, G7 and G7A tobaccos. We have developed no procedures to control either nitrates or nitrosamine levels in our products. Our major competitor has patented several chemical and microbiological procedures for removal of nitrates from various tobacco materials. It would be prudent for our R&D organization to develop procedures for control of tobacco nitrates and nitrosamines.

Recently two lines of evidence have implicated that cellular heat shock proteins (hap) ray pay «role in steroid hormonal regulation of target tissues, One i the demonstration that cellular 90K tp (hsp-90) can complex with steroid recep tors in vitro and inhibit their ability to interact with DNA, and second, the demonstration that in wan oviduct ex steroids can ‘regulate the synthesis ofhsp-108.

The posable Dhyiological significance of estiogenic stimulation of uterine ‘hsp-90 has been discussed. (Endocrinology 123: 956-961, 1988) 1988) regulation of mutine werine hp-80, We report thet ovariectomy H™ shock proteins are a group of related proteins, which are induced in response to stress in a wide range of eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells (1, 2). The classical inducers of these proteins in eukaryotic cells are elevation in temperature (heat), heavy metals, alco- hol, and glucose starvation. The precise function of these proteins is not known, but overall they are thought to be intimately involved in maintaining tissue homeostasis, Recently, one of the stress proteins, the 90K heat shock protein (hsp-90) has received considerable attention with regard to its possible role in regulating steroid hormone action in target tissues. A cellular hsp-90 has been shown to be associated with a variety of molybdate-stabilized nonactivated steroid-receptor complexes (3, 4), and this association has been found to be responsible for main- taining the receptor in a state unable to interact with DNA in vitro (65, 6). It has also been speculated that hsp- ‘90 may satisfy the criteria for the in vivo cellular protein, responsible for masking the DNA-binding site of the receptor in the absence of steroid (5-8), In addition to the documentation that hsp-90 can complex with steroid receptors in vitro there are two reports which reveal that steroid hormones can regulate the synthesis of hsp.

Similarly, in L929 cells dexamethasone has been shown to augment the synthesis of hsp-90 (10). ‘These observations suggest the possibility that in target tissues for steroids, steroid hormones and cellular hsp-90 may ‘mutually regulate their cellular functions. For the last 2 decades the rodent uterus has been used Widely as a model system for delineating the mechanisin of estrogen action and estrogen receptors in mammalian cells. Therefore, it seemed plausible to us that an exam. ination of the potential relationship between estrogen action and cellular hsp-90 in mouse uterine tissue may Provide us with certain insights concerning the possible cellular function of hsp-90. Accordingly, we have exam- ined the steroid hormonal regulation of hsp-90 in mouse uterus and report that estradiol increases the level of this protein in a steroid- and tissue-specific manner.

This experimental approach was used because ‘the STIT cell line is a well-characterized in vitro adipocyte differentiation system and the pSV3neo plasmid contains the early region of the SV40 genome and a selective marker, G18 resistance. Cell clones containing stably integrated pSV neo which expressed T antigen were isolated in G418-containing medium, Most ofthese cell clones differentiated poorly. However, several clones retained the abil ipocytes, and with these cell clones, it was established that adipocyte differentiation markedly repressed. ‘T-antigen expression, The differentition-speciic repression of T-antigen expression did not result from a loss of proliferative potential associated with terminal differentiation, because it was observed in adipocytes that could be restimolated to proliferate. In such cells, restimulation of cell growth induced ceactivation of ‘T-antigen expression, Repression of T-antigen expression was also demonstrated during differentiation of SV40 ‘T-antigen-immortalized human keratinocytes. These results establish that the process of cellular dilferentiation ‘can repress T-antigen expression In atleast {vo distinet biological systems.

Thus, the apparent activa tion of Topo I observed eatlier (4) probably resulted from a nicking reaction without sabiization of DNA-Topo I complexes (7). Toese data with -lapachone indicated to us that Topo T was involved in [DNA repair and may be exploited after radiation therapy in tumors ‘with elevated levels ofthis enzyme, including melanomas, lung car- tinomas, breast cancers, and colon and prostate cancers (6,9, 10). ‘ince Topo I inhibitors ae known to cause apoptotic reactions (11, 12), we explored f-lapachone-mediated apoptosis in various human, cells.

MALKUS *, P, BUSCHBAUM and A. CASTRO Depertment of Pethology, University of Miami, Miami, Florida 93182 (US.A.) (Received April 6th, 1978) Summary ‘A turbidimetric rate method for the determination of immunoglobulins IgG, IgA, and IgM has been adapted to an automatic kinetic rate analyzer. The pro- cedure can be run on mildly lipemic sera without correction for sample light scatter. We report correlations with results by an immunodiffusion method and a manual laser nephelometric technique. The automated rate procedure C described provides a rapid, accurate, precise and sensitive way to measure immunoglobulins. immunogen Introduction During the past few years there has been considerable clinical interest in developing convenient automated analyses for specific immunoglobulins [1,2]. Although the precipitin reaction was first identified by Krauss in 1897 [3] and ‘the manual nephelometzic quantitative analysis of specific proteins was described by Libby in 1938 [4,5], it has been the recent commercial availability of high quality monospecific antiserum that has led to the development of automated nephelometrie and turbidimetric analyses. The automated equilib- rium techniques developed on continuous flow instrumentation [6,7] and cen- trifugal analyzers [8,9] all require sample blanks due to nonspecific light scat- ter. In an‘attempt to correct for sample induced light scatter a reaction rate analyzer was adapted using an early post mixing reading [10]. A rate method of detecting antibody immunoglobulin complexes was developed on a centri- fugal analyzer modified with a laser for light scatter measurements (11—14]. ‘We have adapted the rate technique which offers the advantage of automatic blank correction to the Perkin Elmer KA-150 kinetic analyzer. The method described here gives excellent sensitivity and a large working range for immuno- gobylins IgG, IgA and IgM. ‘whom correspondence should be addresied.",6

"woe Carcinogenesis Assay of Subfractions of Cigarette Smoke Condensate Prepared by Solvent-Solvent Separation of the Neutral Fraction ** Fred G. Bock, A. P. Swain? and R. L. Stedman,' Roswell Park Memorial Institute, New York State Department of Health, Buffalo, New York 14203; and Eastern Marketing ‘and Nutrition Research Division, Agricultural Reseorch Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Philadelphio, Pennsylvonia 19118 SUMMARY—Carcinosenesis assay was conducted on subfractions of the neuteal fraction (NF) of cigarette smoke condensate, subfractions that were prepared by solvent partition. Of the 2 mojor subficctions, the “methanol- ingoluble” neutrals (MIN) were much more active than’ the “methanol- soluble” neutrals (MSN). Distibution of MSN between nitromethane ond carbon disulfide yielded 2 ective fractions. Poot dose-response effects suggest that extraneous materials may teduce the activity of MSN. Analysis of the recovery of MSN is difficult, but opoarently there were significant losses ducing separation. On countticurent distribution (CCD), MIN yielded 3 octive and 2 inactive subfractions. Recovery of the activity of MIN jn the subfractions was excellent in comparison with an eatlier separa- ie acid chromatostophy. Recoveries might be improved if 18 AN earlier study, 4 of the subfractions prepared silicic acid chromatography of the neutral frac- te (CSC) induced skin tumors in. mice. previously painted with 125 ug of 7,12-dimethylbenafalanthracene (DMBA) (1). With this procedure, tumor-promot~ ing agents as well as complete carcinogens were detected. All the subfractions were recombined in proportion to their yield, to provide a reconstituted sample that would have been identical with NF if no changes had occurred during the separation procedure. The biological activity of this recon- stituted material, however, was substantially less than that of NF, suggesting that important amounts of the active materials were lost during chroma- tography. The current study was undertaken to examine solvent partitioning alone as means of fractionating NF, with the, hope that these loses could be avoided. MATERIALS AND METHODS Details of the preparation of the various fractions will be described elsewhere (2).

You may already be aware that the US Department of Health and Human Services has requested information from tobacco manu- facturers relating to the ingredients commonly added to commer- cially manufactured cigarettes. This request was made as first step by HHS in compliance with Section 403 of Public Law 95-626 which requires that the Secretary of this Department ""shall conduct, or arrange the conduct of, a study or studies of, (1) the relative health -risks associated with smoking cigarettes of varying levels of tar, nicotine, and carbon monoxide; and (2) the health risks associated with smoking cigarettes containing any substances commonly added to commercially manufactured ciga- rettes."" Various tobacco companies have responded to these xequests giving general information and information not con- sidered to be proprietary in nature. HHS has responded to these submissions asking for more detail. Therefore, as an addendum to the confidentiality agreement “between Lorillard and Firmenich, dated June 1979, I am requesting f from Firmenich a letter authorizing Lorillard to disclose the contents of flavor ingredient lists supplied by Firmenich as part of a composite scrambled list of all flavor ingredients used by Lorillard if a government agency formally demands such disclo- sure. In the event that Lorillard is required by the government to disclose the flavor ingredients used, we intend to supply an alphabetical listing of all ingredients thus making it impossible to determine the composition of any single compounded flavor represented therein. Furthermore, unless specifically required to do so, we do not intend to identify the sources of these ingredients. Therefore, the supplier's proprietary interests will be even more strictly preserved. ZOzezeto",0

Received 6 July 1989/Accepted 1 October 1989 Fischer rat fibroblasts, naturally resistant to killing by the fibrotropic strain of minute virus of mice Lpacvovirus MVM(p)], became sensitive to MVM when transformed by polyomay rus. This sensitization did ‘nat involve an inerease in the pereentage of cells which synthesized viral capsid antigens or in the percentage Of cells which produced infectious virus. The addition of anti-MVM antiserum to the growth medium of ‘MVMGinfected cells had only a small effect on theic survival rates, indicating that the majority of the killing ifec of MVM occurs in a single cycle of infection, The data indicate that cell killing by MVM is independent ‘of infectious virus production and thus support the notion that the preferential cytolytic effect is affected by ‘ral eylotoxic gene products which accumulate to intolerable levels in transformed cells but not in normal ones. Fi iy, using cells transformed with polyom: 'as and genomic and subgenomic clones of polyomavirus, we showed that the extent of sensitization to killing by MVM depended on the transforming agent used. Certain parvoviruses possess the intriguing capability to destroy oncogenically transformed cells selectively in cule ture while having litle or no effect on the viability of the parental, untransformed cells. This preferential toxicity to Transformed cells may account forthe inhibition of intuced tumorigenesis (oncosuppression), reported to occur in Vivo 2.6, 8, 11, 22, 25-27). ""a variety of ells have been used to study the preferential killing effect of autonomous parvoviruses. These include tmouse 313 eels (13-15), several at lroblast cel ines (13), and human Rbroblasis and epithelial cells (3,4). A variety of transforming agents have also been used, including simian virus 40 (1, 4 10, 14, 13), avian erythroblestosis vins (3), human ras'oncogene (18), and radiation and chemical ca inogens (1,4). These studies show that (the killing efect. of transformed cells is dependent neither on the type of cell. for on the transforming agent used and (i) the preferential Killing of transformed cells is correlated with clevated expression of the viral genome. In this study, we invest- faled the question of whether the production of infectious Virus was required forthe selective iling effect of minute Virus of mice (MVM), “The Fischer rat embryo fibroblast cell line (F-11) chosen for this study is subject to astringent contact inhibition, its anchorage-independent grovih i extremely low, and it has @ very typieal broblastc appearance. These properties allow relatively easy isolation of cells with transformed pheno- types (2), The F-lLL and F-L1UVPy (polyomavirus-trans. formed F-1L1) cell lines used in this study were obtained from T.

MYM(p) iofection caused a transient and slight cytopathic effect at days 1 and 2, after which the culture recovered and a normal growth rate was resumed. In contrast, the polyomavirusetransformed deriv- ative cell lines were destroyed completely by MVM(p) infection within 24 h (Fig. 1). The total yield of infectious virus produced in polyomavirus-transformed cells was 10° to 10%-fold higher than that produced in similarly infected ‘untransformed cell lines (Table 1). This difference range in virus yield is comparable with those of other permissive! restrictive systems for MVM (9, 20, 21, 24). A subline of mouse L-cells, A9 [which is used as a standard permissive cell line for MVM(p)], was also included in all our experi ments for comparison. Table 1 shows that virus production in A9 cells was only slightly lower than in F-111/Py cells. To investigate the relationship between the killing effect and virus production, cell killing during a single cycle of infection was quantitated by using an infectious center lassay. This assay was performed as follows. At 4 h post fection the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline to remove unattached and unabsorbed virus, trypsinized, suspended in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium containing 35 mM HEPES (N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'= 2ethanesulfonic acid) buller (pH 7.3) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, and counted. Serial dilutions were prepared in the above medium, poured onto 60-mm dishes Containing monolayers of § X 10° A9 indicator cell, and incubated for 4 10 8 h {0 allow all cells to attach. The monolayers were overlaid with agar, incubated for 5 to 6 days at 37°C, and then stained with 0.2% neutral red in Hanks salts solution containing 0 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.3, and 0.45% Bacto-Agar (Difco Laboratories). Plaques were counted 20 later. These assays consistently showed that the MVM(p) permissive fraction in F-111 cells was nearly identical to that found in the polyomavirus transfor mmants (Table 1), alhough the lethal effect of MVM(p) was fitch more pronounced on the latter. Furthermore, irmm nofluorescence staining revealed similar percentages of cells",6

"(Date! Name Addrese address Dear Name: The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OsHA) is currently considering workplace smoking regulations that, if enacted, would virtually ban smoking at all indoor worksites -- including Philip Morris U.S.A. Under this proposal, employers would only be able to accommodate smokers if they constructed separate smoking rooms with completely separate ventilation systems. Advocates of these new rules are well aware that most employers cannot afford to provide separately ventilated smoking rooms, and that the proposed rules actually constitute a nationwide workplace smoking ban. Even more troubling, OSHA's definition of ""workplace"" is so broad it encompasses almost any indoor location where an employee is present -- including your own home if you employ a plumber to fix your sink. Other ""workplaces"" where smoking would be banned include all restaurants, bars, hotel rooms, private offices and company vehicles. Smoking would not even be allowed in a room rented for a private party or function. Fortunately, there is still an opportunity to amend or even prevent the proposed workplace smoking rules. From now until August 13, OSHA will accept public comment on the workplace smoking ban. To have your comments entered into the official OSEA file on this issue, please follow these three simple steps: 1. Take a few minutes to write a brief letter telling OSHA that designated smoking areas are preferable to the severe restrictions now being considered; 2. Make three copies of your letter (this is to comply with federal law; 3. Put your original letter, along with the three copies inside one envelope and mail to: OSHA Docket Docket No. H-122 4660828202",0

Crothers"" Department of Chemistry, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut 06511 Received November 12, 1992; Revised Manuscript Received February 10, 1993 ApsTract: We have used a combination of physical and motecular biological techniques to examine the structure of Leptomonas collosoma spliced leader RNA. We confirm the general features of the previously proposed structure for the 3’ half of the RNA, in which a single-stranded region is flanked by two stem loops. However, we find that the 5’ half of the RNA, which contains the spice site, has two competing secondary structures which differ only slightly in stability and which can interconvert on a fast (<1 s) time scale, In the favored conformation, a stable hairpin helix is augmented by conserved complementarity between the splice site and the S’end ofthe SL RNA. This putative helix has anomalous nuclease sensitivity and thermal stability features, suggesting that itis probably coupled by unknown tert other nucleotides in the 5? half-molecule, The structure offers intriguing parallels with RNA-RNA. 5301 interactions in the mammalian splicing system. Pre-mRNA splicing sa processby which anintron sexcised and the exons are then ligated [reviews: Padgett etal. (1986); Maniatis and Reed (1987)]; intermediates in the cs splicing reaction have been well characterized. The trans splicing reaction of trypanosomes and nematod involves the transfer of a 5’ exon (22-41 nuclot froma short (<200 nucleotide) spliced leader transcript onto 4 preexisting mRNA (Konarska etal, 1985; Murphy eta, 1986; Sutton & Boothroyd, 1986). In trypanosomes all of themature mRNAs contain the spliced leader at their ends. A trans spliced leader is also found in a small pereentage of nematode mRNAs (Kraus & Hirsh, 1987; Blumenthal & ‘Thomas, 1988). ‘The proposed secondary structure for the kinetoplastid spliced leader (SL) RNAS (Bruzik et al, 1988) was based upon relative free energies predicted by the Fold program (Zuker, 1989) and upon conservation ofthe folding pattern for several SL RNAs. This structural conservation among the trypanosomatid SL RNAs is striking due tothe lack of length and sequence homology ouside ofthe spliced leader exon portion of the molecule, The proposed secondary structure contains three stem loops, the second and third of which flank a single-stranded region which has the sequence ofa binding ste for Sm proteins (Mattaj, 1988). The latter arecommon splicing proteins that areimmunoprecipitable by antibodies found in the serum of certain autoimmune patients (Lemer & Stcitz, 1979). In vitro assembly of SL RNA snRNPs with HeLa cell Sm proteins, followed by immuno- precipitation with anti-Sm antibodies (Bruzik eta, 1988), shows that the putative Sm protein binding site of the SL RNAsisactiveinproteia binding. U! independenceof splicing the trans spliced leader to an adenovirus exon in cis has also been demonstrated using Ul-depleted HeLa cell extracts (Bruzik & Steitz, 1990). This result led to the proposal that {he functional domain for 5 splice site identification in trans splicing resides in the SL sa RNP itself and not ina UI RNA sa RNP.

This approach yielded the predicted results for the 3 but not the 5’ half of the molecule. We also examined the thermal unfolding equilibria and kinetics for the molecule, ‘using the temperature-jump (T-jump) technique, in which ‘thesampleis rapidly heated and the optical changeis measured asa function of time. We found a low-temperature thermal transition which could not be accounted for by unfolding of Ihelies in the model of Bruzik et al. (1988), Subsequent experiments localized this effect to the 5’half of the molecule. We then employed mutagenesis and polyacrylamide gel clectrophoresis methods such as ribonuclease mapping (Douth- waite & Garrett, 1981; Celander & Cech, 1990) and base rmodification/interference experiments (Peattie, 1979; Conway & Wickens, 1989; Weeks et al., 1990) to probe the structure ofthe S‘halfof LeptomonascollosomaSLRNA. We propose anew structure in which a stable hairpin helix is augumented by pairing of the 5’ end of the SL RNA with the spice site. ‘The hairpin helix has a measured Ty about 6 °C higher than the analogous helix proposed by Broziketal. (1988). However, the putative splice site helix bas unusual properties, including ‘anomalously small thermal stability changes upon mutation, single-strand nuclease sensitivity a the splicesite,and apparent tertiary interactions with additional nucteotides in the 5"" half of the SLRNA. We speculate that the internal spice site pairing may be analogous to pairing ofthe 5’ end of Ul with the 5’ splice site in mammalian pre-mRNA splicing (Zhuang & Weiner, 1986), MATERIALS AND METHODS DNA Oligonucleotides.

Department of Surgical Oncology, University of California San Diego, La Jella, California 92093; land ""Department of Pharmacology, Darmouth Medical School, Hanover, New Hampshire 03755 Abstract [A twofold change in the cisplatin (DDP) sensitivity of 2008 hhuman ovarian carcinoma cells is sufficient to reduce tumor response in vivo. The DDP sensitivity of these cells can be enhanced by activation of the epidermal growth factor and pro- ‘ein kinase C signal transduction pathways. We report here that two endogenous growth factors, bombesin and tumor ne- crosis factor alpha (TNFa), enhanced DDP sensitivity by fac- tors of 1.70.1 (SD)-fold and 1.80.1 (SD)-fold, respectively. Both agents also produced sensitization in an 11-fold DDP-re- sistant 2008 subline, Neither bombesin nor TNFa changed the accumulation of DDP, glutathione content, or glutathione-S- transferase activity in 2008 cells. However, a 2-h exposure to ‘oth bombesin and TNFa was suficent to increase 2008 clon- ing efficiency by up to 2.60.1 (SD)-fold and 2.220.1 (SD)- fold, and it increased average colony size by 1.3520.1 (SD)- fold and 1.55+0.1 (SD)-fol, respectively. Bombesin increased intracellular free calcium, and this was blocked by the bombe- sin receptor-specific antagonist SC196, demonstrating that 2008 cells have functional bombesin receptors. These results indicate that bombesin and TNFa can enhance sensitivity to DDP in both DDP sensitive and resistant variants of a human ‘ovarian carcinoma and that both agents serve as growth factors for this tumor.

Furthermore, when TNFa was administered for the treatment of intraperitoneal ovarian cancer xenografts, although it pro longed survival in tumor-bearing mice (10), it also promoted ‘the establishment of multiple subperitoneal tumors. Like 12- (O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), TNFa activates PKCin some cell types and thisin turn may result in increased [AP-| activity and induction of AP-1-responsive genes (14). ‘This is considered to be a key mechanism mediating at least some ofthe biological effects of TNFa mentioned above. ‘We have previously reported that TPA activation of PKC increased DDP sensitivity by a factor of 2.5-fold in human ovarian carcinoma 2008 cells (15). Likewise, epidermal growth factor (EGF), another potent activator of PKC, en hhances DDP sensitivity by 3.1-f0ld in the same cel line (16). We report here that bombesin and TNFa, two endogenous ligands whose receptors have the potential of activating PKC, are also potent modulators of DDP sensitivity in 2008 cells ‘and, moreover, are both mitogenic for this tumor.

Kessler, M.D.., the agency's ‘commissioner. The lawsuit was filed for the purpose of asking the court to declare that the FDA does not have the jurisdiction to regulate cigarettes. ""As an advertising and marketing agency, we fully agree with the tobacco companies that the Food and Drug Administration simply has no authority to regulate tobacco, nor activities related to it,"" said Roger Beahm, president of Coyne Beahm Inc. ""As we understand the FDA's proposed rules, they would have a significant effect on Our business. In addition to regulating the manufacturers, the FDA intends to regulate advertising and marketing agencies such as ours, and retailers who sell cigarettes. We believe the FDA simply does not have that authority. ""We all agree kids shouldn't smoke. If that is the objective of the FDA, these rules make it an objective designed to fail. The proposed regulations don't deal with the real factors affecting why kids smoke -- that is peer and family influences. While we recognize access is an issue, the tobacco companies are already implementing programs which research has shown to reduce underage access. It appears that rather than trying to take action which would really help keep cigarettes out of the hands of children, the FDA has decided to try to regulate not only the tobacco industry, but advertising and marketing agencies like ours, and retailers who are involved in the sale of cigarettes, We hope the FDA will reconsider, and that a truly workable plan designed to help keep cigarettes out of the hands of children can be agreed upon.” Coyne Beahm Inc. is a six-year-old advertising and marketing agency with offices in Nerth Carolina and New York.

"6149 Identification of a Cysteine Residue Essential for Activity of Protein Farnesyltransferase Cys®° IS EXPOSED ONLY UPON REMOVAL OF ZINC FROM TH NZYME, Protein farnesyltransferase (FTase) is a zinc met- alloenzyme that performs a post-translational modifica tion on many proteins that is critical for their function. The importance of eysteine residues in FTase activity was investigated using eysteine-specifie reagents. Zine depleted FTase (apo-FTase), but not the holocnzyme, ‘was completely inactivated by treatment with N-othy! maleimide (NEM). Similar effects were detected after treatment of the enzyme with iodoacetamide. The addi tion of zinc to apo-F""Tase protects it from inactivation by NEM. These findings indicated the presence of specific yateine rosidue(s), potentially located at the zine bind: ing site, that are required for FTase activity. We per- formed a selective labeling strategy whereby the eys- teine residues exposed upon removal of zine from the enzyme were modified with (HJNEM. The enzyme so * modified was digested with trypsin, and four labeled fied and sequenced, one peptide Being the major site of labeling and the rema Inbeled to lesser extents. The major labeled peptide con- tained a radiolabeled cysteine residue, Cys”, that is in teins retained the ability to bind farnesy! diphosphate, they were found to have lost essentially all catalytic activity and ability to bind rine. These results indicate that the Cys in the B subunit of FTase plays a critical role in catalysis by the enzyme and is likely to be one of, the residues that directly coordinate the zine atom in this enzyme.

Secondary objectives of the research were to have the target smoke several of the prototypes and relate their reactions to the cigarette. Additionally, we were interested in the target's responses to several packaging options and various promotion and on-pack insert concepts. METHODOLOGY Qualitative research was conducted in Chicago on August 28 and 29, 1989. Most participants were shown 7-9 advertising OOH comps and asked io write down and then discuss several topics regarding the advertising. ‘The topies can be summarized as follows: - To what age group would this advertising appeal the most? - Is the advertising aimed at men, women or both? - How would you describe the woman in the advertising? = Can you relate to the woman in the ads? Next, participants were asked to review and discuss six print executions and various headlines which could appear on the ads. In addition to the product testing, respondents were exposed to several packaging options, promotion and on-pack insert concepts. r i Nite aisle 1027 EAN (OI S86 PIS 88€8 6IZos",0

Reynolds Tobacco Co., Philip Morris USA, and Ge the Tobacco Institute have introduced youth-oriented education € Y \ programs on smoking. But critics simply do not buy into the companies’ claims that they do not want young people to use or buy sent their products. ""We find their efforts to be insincere at best and ( ees \ harmful at worst,"" says Michael Eriksen, director of the federal Orfice R chord) on Smoking and Health. In fact, some tobacco foes insist that the tol ‘way in which companies present smoking in these tobacco education programs~-as a privileged decision reserved for adults only~actually increases adolescent smoking. Dr. Joseph R. DiFranza and a colleague caused a sti when they concluded that the campaigns encourage tobacco use. ""Children who might never have considered tobacco use to be an option are taught that they must make a decision about using tobacco,” DiFranza wrote. ""Not surprisingly, some decide to try it"" Dr. Thomas J. Glynn of the National Cancer Institute agrees. “Anyone who has kids 12 to 15 years old at home knows that telling them an activity is for adults only is the surest way to get them to try it."" RJ. Reynolds has especially been blasted for its ""Right Decisions, Right Now"" brochure for adolescents, which does not use the Joe Camel cartoon mascot to deliver the anti-smoking message. Critics say if RJR really wanted to eliminate youthful smoking, it would use Joe Camel to do so. ""If they were serious, they could use Joe Camel's imagery to get the message out to kids not to smoke,” says Eriksen. Passive Smoking Affects Children, Women, Studies Say* Reuters (02/03/94) London—Two studies to be published Friday in the British Medical Journal report that secondhand smoke leaves physical traces in children and can cause heart disease in women. In the first study, Chinese researchers at the University of Hong Kong and the military ‘medical university in Xian found that women whose husbands smoked were twice as likely to develop coronary heart disease. ‘Women whose co-workers smoked were two-and-a-half times more likely to develop the disease. The researchers said, ""Passive ‘smoking at work is a risk factor for coronary heart disease. Urgent public health measures are needed to reduce smoking and to protect non-smokers from passive smoking in China.” In the second study, researchers coordinated by epidemiologist Derek Cook of St. George's Hospital Medical School in London found that children ‘exposed to passive smoke had clear by-products of tobacco nicotine in their saliva. The survey of more than 2,000 children measured levels of nicotine by-product cotinine in the saliva. The researchers ‘wrote, “Our data confirm that parental smoking is the most important source of passive exposure to smoke in young children... Overall, ‘maternal smoking contributed more to children's burden of cotinine Velleozezoz",9

"The Biosynthesis of Membrane-derived Oligosaccharides A MEMBRANE-BOUND PHOSPHOGLYCEROI. Barbara J. Jackson and Bugene P. Kennedy} (Mteceive for publication, September 21982) From the Department of Biological Chemistry, Harvard Medical Sol, Huston, Massachusetts 02118 ved oligosnecharides, found in the Escherichia coli periplasmic space (Schulman, Hund Kennedy, B. P. (1979) J. Bacteriol. 137, 686-688), are composed of 8-10 units of glucose, the sole sugar, in 3-2 and fil-+6 linkages (Schneider, J. F., Reinhold, \., Rumley, M. K., and Kennedy, E. P. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 10135-10188). Oligosaccharides in this fam- ily are variously substituted with succinyl ester resi- dues, ax well as with 6n-I-phosphoglycerol and phosphocthanolamine, both derived from membrane Phospholipids. These negatively charged oligoxwecha- Fides may function in cellular osmoregulation since their evnthesis is under osmotic control (Kennedy, P. (1982) Proc. Na U.S. A. 79, 1092-1095). ‘We now report initial characterization of an enzyme catalyzing transfer of phosphoglycerol residuee from phosphatidylglycerol to membrane-derived oligosuc- charides or to synthetic f-glucoside acceptors. The products are en-1,2-diglyceride and f-glucoside-6-phos phoglyeerol.

This suggested the possibility that the BaP in cigarette smoke might account for the high degree of association between cigarette smoking and lung cancer; and it suggested the possibility that BaP pollution of urban air might perhaps increase the risk of lung cancer~ Wynder and Hoffman found an average of 2.5 micrograms of BaP in the smoke from 100 American cigarettes smoked mechanically.

Another expression of this hypothesis is that ""smoking behaviour of women and birth weights of their children are influenced by the individual genotype or constitution""®, The British Medical Journal @ common cause editortal“does not merely suggest, but asserts that ""no reasonable doubt now remains that smoking in pregnancy has adverse effects on the developing fetus"". As we have noted®, the editortal overlooked several reports that disagree, especially those of Yerushalmy. Ross and colleagues”, and Goldstein’, deny having inferred causality from correlation. To the causal quotation cited In the Nature editorial” may be added their own assertion®, bosed on statistics, that ""cigarette smoking during pregnancy Increased the fetal plus neonatal mortality rate by 28 percent and reduced birth weight by 170g...""

ELEM? axo R LOVE Department of Pathology, Thomas efereon University, Philadelphi, Pennayteanta 19107 ABSTRACT Cultures of human diploid fibroblasts (HDF) exhibiting density dependent inhibition of replication (DDIR) resumed thelr progression through the cell cycle following medium replacement and, after a lag period of two hours, showed a dramatic increase in the incidence of isonucleolinar* cells and in the levels of uptake of *H-uridine into the nucleoli. Between five and ten hours after refeeding these nucleolar changes wore maximal, leveling off at the highest val- ues, in periods corresponding to late G1 and ealy §. Concomitantly, a parallel ‘merease in the number of nucleolin per cell occurred, As cells progressed through 8 and G2 phases the nucleolin! decreased in nimber and reverted to the aniso- ‘nucleolinar type. The intensity of nucleolar labeling by “H-uridine and lts corre. Inte, the frequency of cells with labeled nucleoli, also decreased ducing these cell ceyele stages. Both pre- and postreplicative periods of mitotic quiescence were characterized by high levels of anisonucleolinosis (60-80% of the cells) and by very low levels of nucleolar +H-uridine incorporation, ‘The magnitude of these nucleolar changes occurring during G1 stage was found (o be strongly dependent on: (1) the length of time of contact between the cells and the fresh medium, at least eight hours of contact being necessary for ‘maximal response; (2) the amount of serum in the medium, the optimal serum concentration being between 10 and $0%, and (3) the pH of the medium. The nucleolar response was completely abolished at pH values below 7.0, These nucle. lar changes were very sensitive t the presence of cycloheximide (10 nglml) fand actinomycin D (0.003 gil), The behavior of the nucleoli in response to these parameters was similar t the activation response of the cells to inidate DNA synthesis. During the time period of maximal nucleolar “activation” the onset of DNA ‘synthesis as well a3 the morphological and autoradiographic manifestations of the nucleolar activation were completely inhibited by vary low levels of actino- ‘myein D (Ellem and Mironescu, ""72, a selective inhibitor of nucleolar RNA syn. thests (Perzy, 65). This suggested a possible role of nucleolar metabolism, in nor ‘mal diploid cells, inthe initiation of DNA synthesis. Our results, however, seera to indicate that the nucleolar changes are necessary but not suifcient for the ‘subsequent initiation of DNA synthesis, since with graded serum concentrations ‘or medium volumes, smaller levels of a stimulus were needed to produce maximal -isonucleolinosis than to effect a maximum replicative response in the celle. Recent results indicate that, in the ab- sence of any medium change, replication of some human (Rhode and Ellem, ’68) or ro- dent (Todaro et al.,'65) cell lines on a solid substrate in vitro’ ccases when a critical cellular density is, reached (density de- ‘pendent inhibition of replication — DDIR). Celis can be roleased from DDIR by the addition of fresh medium or by addition of certain small molecular woight nutrients J Cent Pavston, 82: 438-400, to the depleted medium (Smets, ""71; Ellem and Mironescu, '73). Usually, in cells ex- hibiting DDIR, synthesis of ribosomal RNA (Levine et al., ""65; Rhode and Ellem, '68) 4s greatly reduced or virtually ceases, and the cells are blocked at the GI level (Nil- hausen and Green, '65), Addition of fresh complete medium (Rhode and Ellem, '68) Teceved Feb. 27,78, Aocopied July 18°73, See toomotes tap 2 445 50219599",6

Gonzalez, Karl-Heinz Jockel, Martin Krauss, Lothar Kreienbrock, Michaela Kreuzer, Anabela Mendes, Franco Merlesti, Fredrik Nyberg, Goran Pershagen, Hermann Pohlabeln, Elio Riboli, Giovanni Schmid, Lorenzo Simonato, Jean Trédaniel, Elise Whitley, Heinz-Erich Wichmann, Carlos Winck, Paola Zambon, Rodolfo Saracci Background: An association between exposure to environ- ‘mental tobacco smoke (ETS) and tung cancer risk has been suggested. To evaluate this possible association better, re- searchers need more precise estimates of risk, the relative contribution of different sources of ETS, and the effect of| ETS exposure on different histologic types of lung cancer. To address these issues, we have conducted a case-control study of lung cancer and exposure to ETS in 12 centers from seven European countries. Methods: A total of 650 patients with Tung cancer and 1542 control subjects up to 74 years of age ‘were interviewed about exposure to ETS, Neither ease sub- Jects nor control subjects had smoked more than 400 ciga- rettes in ther lifetime, Results: ETS exposure during child- hhood was not associated with an increased risk of lung cancer (odds ratio [OR] for ever exposure = 0.78; 95% con- fidence interval [CT] = 0.64-0.96). The OR for ever exposure ‘0 spousal ETS was 1.16 (95% CI = 093-144). No clear ‘dose-response relationship could be demonstrated for cumu- lative spousal ETS exposure. The OR for ever exposure to workplace ETS was 1.17 (98% CI =0.94-145), with possible ‘evidence of increasing risk for inereasing duration of expo- sure. No increase in risk was detected in subjects whose ‘exposure to spousal or workplace ETS ended more than 15 ‘years earlier. Ever exposure to ETS from other sources was not associated with lung cancer risk. Risks from combined ‘exposure to spousal and workplace ETS were higher for ‘squamous cell carcinoma and small-cell carcinoma than for adenocarcinoma, but the differences were not statistically significant. Conclusions: Our results indicate no association between childhood exposure to ETS and lung cancer risk. We did find weak evidence of a dose-response relationship between risk of lung cancer and exposure to spousal and workplace ETS. There was no detectable risk after cessation of exposure. [J Natl Cancer Inst 1998;90:1440-0} During the last 15 years, epidemiologic studies have been ‘conducted on the association between exposure to envit 1440 ARTICLES tal tobacco stoke (ETS) and tung cancer. Several authors and regulatory agencies have concluded that causal link has been established (e.g. see (/~3)], whereas some authors consider that bias and confounding factors constitute a plausible explanation for the observed association (e.g, see 4]. The available studies ‘are—in most cases—too small to adequately assess the magni- tude of the effect and to address specific aspects, such as the shape of the dose-response relationship, the effect of cessation ‘of exposure, the importance of multiple sources of ETS expo- sure, nd the interaction of ETS exposure with other risk factors ‘of lung cancer. Furthermore, celatively few studies of such ex- posure are available from Europe (5-10). Characteristic of to- bacco smoking in European countries are the mixed consump: tion of blond and black tobacco cigereties (J/) and the low prevalence—at least in the past—of smoking among women ‘compared with men (12).

"THE NONLINEAR DOSE-RESPONSE HYPOTHESIS OF ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO SMOKE AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE CJ Smith', TH Fischer’, $ B Sears’ and J C Walker! 'R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, USA University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, USA. ABSTRACT ‘The hypothesis that environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) increases risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in nonsmokers has recently received attention because of two published government reports. Epidemiology studies report that the relative risk for CVD associated with actively smoking twenty cigarettes per day is 1.78. Active smoking exposes the smoker to approximately 16 times the ETS concentration, and 100 to 300- fold the total smoke dose, experienced by @ nonsmoker. These government reports estimate the relative risk for ischemic heart disease in ETS-exposed nonsmokers at 1.30 (CALEPA) and 1.23 (SCOTH), despite the much lower smoke exposure. Platelet aggregation is proposed as a plausible and quantitatively consistent mechanism to explain this nonlinear dose-response anomaly. Herein, evidence is presented suggesting that this low-dose hypothesis is inconsistent with the literature on the cardiovascular pathology of active smoking, the physiology of platelets and with the results from a human exposure chamber study. INTRODUCTION The development or exacerbation of cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been called the most scrious health effect allegedly associated with environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure in nonsmokers, ‘The California Environmental Protection Agency (CALEPA) has estimated that approximately 47,500 CVD deaths occur in the U.S. each year due to TS exposure [1]. The U.S. EPA’s estimate for U.S. lung cancer deaths associated with ETSis 3,800 (2). ‘The magnitude of the epidemiological association between CVD and active cigarette smoking is problematic for proponents of a causal association between ETS exposure and CVD. Specifically, the relative risk (RR) of CVD in active smokers of twenty cigarettes, per day (one pack) is reportedly 1.78 [3]. Recent relative risk estimates for CVD and ETS include 1,30, as calculated by the California Environmental Protection Agency (CALEPA) [1], and 1.23, as determined by the Scientific Committee on Tobacco and Health (SCOTH) [4] in the U.K. According to these estimates, the CVD risk associated with ETS exposure is approximately one-third of the CVD risk associated with actively smoking twenty cigarettes per day. 6zOb LEles RJRO000000001 106746. 70050 7007",2

"Br Heart 11989362:353-60 A study of nerves containing peptides in the pulmonary vasculature of healthy infants and children and of those with pulmonary hypertension KIM MALLUN, JOHN WHARTON,* JULIA M POLAK,* SHEILA G HAWORTH From the Institute of Child Health and *Reyal Postgraduate Medical School, London sumMARY | Nerves containing peptides that supply the human intrapulmonary vasculature were studied in 21 controls aged one month to 24 years and in 13 patients with pulmonary hypertension, aged 11 days to cight years. An indirect immunofluorescence technique was used to study the distribution and relative density of nerve fibres containing the general ncuronal marker, protein gene product 9'5; tyrosine hydroxylase; synaptophysin; neuropeptide tyrosine; vasoactive intestinal polypeptide; substance P, somatostatin; and calcitonin gene related peptide. Atall ages in normal and hypertensive lungs neuropeptide tyrosine was the predominant neuropeptide associated with the pulmonary vascular nerves. In normal lungs the relative density of nerve fibres increased during childhood only in the arteries of the respiratory unit. Pulmonary hypertension ‘was associated with the premature innervation of these arteries during the first year of lif. Innervation of small, abnormally thick-walled pre-capillary vessels by predominantly vasocon- strictor nerves may help to explain the susceptibility of infants to pulmonary hypertensive crises. ‘There is no reliable effective medical treatment for pulmonary hypertension. Children with potentially reversible pulmonary vascular disease can die after a ‘technically successful intracardiac repair because of the development of pulmonary hypertensive crises that become intractable to al forms of treatment Pharmacolological management of pulmonary hypertension might be improved by understanding. how the pulmonary vasculature is innervated in such hung. the wall structure of ial tree is remodelled Connective tissue is deposited and medial smooth muscle cells differentiate, acquiring a contractile rather than a synthetic phenotype,"" The concentra- tion of contractile myoflaments increases and the type of cytoskeletal proteins change.” In children with pulmonary hypertensive congenital heart dis- cease these changes are accelerated or abnormal.’ The relation between remodelling of the pulmonary arteries and pulmonary innervation in the human Jung is unclear.

The approaches used to denitrate the’ burley are: 1, Extraction with water (see attached memo from J. W. Leik to G. D.

We now know that cancer of the lung is not the whole story: for every tobacco-associated death from that cause there are wo or thee from other diseases. That has made a bad situation worse.

"May 30, 1990 Mayor Donald M. Fraser 350 South Fifth Street, Room 127 Minneapolis, Minnesota 55415 Dear Mayor Fraser: Your city clerk, Merry Keefe, recently sent our company a copy of Resolution 90R-162, ""Urging R.J. Reynolds Company to cease planned cigarette advertising campaigns aimed at youth, people of color and young women."" On behalf of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. and its 12,500 employees, I object to the fact that the Minneapolis government has passed a resolution that grossly misleads the public about our company and our products. First, you urge our company to stop doing something that we are not doing. We do not advertise or wish to promote our products to anyone under the age of 18. Nor do we have any interest or engage in any activity designed to encourage nonsmokers, regardless of age, to start smoking. Our company's sole focus is trying to convince current adult smokers that our brands are more desirable than those of our competitors. Reynolds Tobacco manufactures and markets a legal product that is enjoyed daily by 50 million Americans, and we don't need to make any excuses for what we do. If you are an adult who currently smokes, we want your business; if you are not, we don't. It simple as that, and anyone who accuses us of acting otherwise either misinformed or intentionally misrepresenting what we do. Second, concerning the resolution's accusations about ""people of color and young women,"" our products are marketed to all current adult smokers and are enjoyed by male and female adults of virtually every racial and ethnic background. In our opinion, your resolution is extremely patronizing to those individuals you purport to protect. You are assuming that these adults do not’ have the intelligence and common sense to make up their own minds about common lifestyle choices, such as smoking. Third, if you are going to accuse us of intentionally trying to take advantage of people and harm their health, you should present all of the facts, not just those that. support your bias. Your resolution states that ""numerous studies have demonstrated causal links between smoking and increased cases of cancer, coronary heart disease, chronic lung diseases and low birth weight babies 99S TLL05",0

"‘Nucleic Acids Research, 1993, Vol. 21, No. 8 1889-1893 Construction of recombinant DNA by exonuclease recession Yih-Sheng Yang, William J.Watson, Philip W.Tucker and J.Donald Capra’ jestem Medical Department of Microbiology, The University of Texas Southwest fedical Center at Dallas, 5323 Harry Hines Bivd, Dallas, TX 75236-9048, USA. Received December 22, 1992; Revised and Accepted March 18, 1993 ABSTRACT We describe a new exonuclease-based method for joining and/or constructing two or more DNA molecules. DNA fragments containing ends complementary to those of a vector or another independent molecules were generated by the polymerase chain. reaction. The 3’ ends of these ‘molecules as well as the vector DNA were then recessed by exonuclease activity and annealed in an orientation-determined manner via thelr complemen- tary single-stranded regions. This recombinant DNA an be transformed directly into bacteria without a further ligase-dependent reaction. Using this approach, We have constructed recombinant DNA molecules rapidly, efficiently and directionally. This method can effectively replace conventional protocols for PCR cloning, PCR SOEing, DNA subcloning and site- directed mutagenesis. INTRODUCTION ‘The use ofthe polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in nucleic acid esearch has provided a convenient way to amplify and construct, genes. In most cases, subcloning of PCR products is required for further manipulation and generally involves the incorporation of restriction sites a the ends of PCR products (1,2), or blunt. ended ligation of PCR products into the vector (3). However, cloning of PCR products is often less straightforward than anticipated. The main problems which need tobe solved in blunt ended cloning of PCR products include the removal of extra ‘nucleotides added tothe 3” ends by Taq DNA polymerase (3,4), the prevention of non-recombinant backgrounds, and the low efficiency of the blunt-end ligation reaction, The T/A cloning system (Invitrogen) has been used to overcome the extra ‘nucleotide problem at the 3” end but an extra dAMP is ‘automatically inserted. This generates. additional problems especialy in expression studies a twill alter the reading fame. Cohesive end cloning (provided by the incorporation of restriction sites at the 5’ end of PCR primers) is a good altemative to blunt tend cloning. Nonetheless, both methods require several steps of DNA fragment purification, ligase-dependent ligation and colony selection to determine the correct orientation of the insert and ate labor intensive, time consuming and/or of low efficiency. Strategies for ligase-free cloning of PCR products have been developed to overcome some of these problems. The recombinant circle PCR (RCPCR) technique generates circular DNA through hhterologous annealing of sequence-overlapped ends on different PCR products (5,6). These circular DNA forms can be transformed direty into bacteria without a ligation procedure. However, this method requires either multiple sets of PCR primers ‘or PCR reamplificaton of  sequence-overlapped ‘molecules to splice insert and vector DNA togethet (7). Also in these applications, both insert and vector DNA must be amplified. Vector DNA amplification adds to the limitation on the size ofthe DNA fragment that can be amplified by Taq DNA. polymerase. An alterate strategy isto create sequence specific, single-stranded ends on both PCR products of inset and vector ends (6~10), then splice them through a sequence homologous annealing process. In most applications, single-stranded ends are generated by the 3’ to 5"" exonuclease activity of T4 DNA polymerase (8,9) with the overlapped sequence specifically Sesigned and incorporated into PCR primers for both insert as well as vector DNA amplification. A specified, unique length of 3 recessed ends is then created in the presence of specific NTP and T4 DNA polymerase and the circular form of DNA, “Sxembled through sequence overlapped ends, is then ready for transformation. An alternative way to produce single-stranded ends employs uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG). This enzyme cleaves all €UMPs which ae incorporated into the PCR primers (11), However, some of these methods, like RCPCR, require ther multiple BCR primer ses, vector amplification, or vector end sequence modifications. Others require a double restriction enzyme cleavage of vector DNA followed bya ligation process for directional cloning (9,10) Recently we developed a simple exonuclease-based strategy to construct PCR products. Ths protocol has the advantages of the Tigasevfree PCR cloning technique but none of the sisadvantages, such as vector amplification, enzymatic ‘manipulation or lack of directional cloning. Here we document its application for constructing bacterial gene fusion mutans for ‘an octamer binding protein (12) To whom corespondtnee should be aed PUBLICATIONS 043641 $039",6

Several analogous studies on acute toxicity of cigarette smoke were performed by ws previously, the most recent one was our No. C187/R5 reported on by letter dated February 13, 1975. The methodology used in the present project was identical to that described previously, especially for C187/R5. We again used GAF1/1J female mice; their body weights ranged from 16.5 to 23.5 gram at the time of the experiment, and their age ranged from approximately 10 to 40 weeks. Care was taken that the age distribution and the body weight distribution of the exper- imental animals was approximately the same for the study of each of the three types of cigarettes. The results are shown on Table J. It is clearly evident that smoke from both types 207 and 213 cigarettes is considerably less toxic than that of IR1 Kentucky reference control cigarettes; these differences are highly significant by statistical criteria with a confidence level far below 0. 1% (t values of 5.83 and 5.98, respectively).

LAWHARERS BASK IN TOBACCO INSTITUTE'S WARMTH. Rep. Hovard Coble, R-N.C., punched a vinning volley in his stadium court tennis match at the Hyatt Grand Champions resort. Rep. Don Sundquist, R-Tenn., teed off vith a drive straight dovn the fairvay at the adjacent Indian Wells Golf Resort. Rep. Alex McMillan, R-N.C., arrived for dinner in a tan-and-green checked sport coat, a vivid contrast to the stark Dlues and grays he typically Vears for Congress. ‘'Nice jacket,'' commented a member of his party. ‘'I only vear this on junkets to California,'' ne joked. Those members of Congress and about 20 others vere enjoying an all- expense-paid life last veek at the fifth annual legislative conference of the Tobacco Institute. That's the association of cigarette makers and other tobacco interests, vhich after 25 years of surgeon generals’ varnings on the dangers of smoking, insists that smoking cannot be directly linked to cancer, heart disease or stroke. The tobacco industry has good reason to get together vith lavmakers. It faces a range of attacks this year, from proposals to raise cigarette taxes to @ ban on tobacco advertising. Not surprisingly, most members of Congress in attendance either hail from tobacco-producing states or sit on key tax, commerce and other committees that handle bills affecting the industry. So vhile official Washington searched the forecasts for snov last veer, the tobacco folk and lavmakers, many accompanied by their spouses, enjoyed the sun and palm trees at a tvo-year-old Southern California hotel that has 12 tennis courts, 4 svimming pools, 3 restaurants and 2 18-hole golf courses, and vhere the cheapest room costs $200 a night. The Tobacco Institute hired bands for dinner and dancing, as vell In addition to Coble and McMillan, Carolinas lavmakers attending at least part of the four-day conference vere: Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and Reps. Tim Valentine, D-N.C., Martin Lancaster, D-N.C., Steve Neal, D-W.C., Charlie Rose, D-N.C., Bill Hefner, D-N.C., and Robin Tallon, D-S.C. Ail but Neal, Hefner and Coble, a bachelor, brought their vives. In addition to travel expenses, most of the lavmakers vill receive a $1,000 honorarium, a kind of appearance fee. They earned it basically by attending a 90-minute seminar to discuss political issues vith some 125 cigarette manufacturers and other Tobacco Institute members. Some heavy hitters, such as Helms and Rep. Dan Rostenkovski chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, gave individual talks. The honoraria are legal. Many lavmakers rely on the fees to increase their income beyond the $89,500 annual salary for senators and representatives. Still, lavmakers acknovledge that the payments offered by special interest groups can pose political problems. The nev Congress may vote on vhether to abolish honoraria as part of a plan to raise lavmakers' salaries to $135,000. D-111., TIMN 0025141",9

There's a bill before the Washangton State Senate that would be @ major problem for your business if it passed. This bill, called $86457, sets up unreasonable and unnecessary restrictions on tobacco product merchandising. It is one of the most intrusive bills ever, giving government bureaucrats new authoraty over your business. in fact, for the first time, state bureaucrats would be given the right to make rules that affect your tobacco merchanidising. Right now, at least, your state legislators have authority over these bureaucr: But if $8645? passes, unelected bureaucrats will have the full authority, not your elected officials. And with full rvle-making authority, there is no telling what kind of regulations will be next. Please protect your oun business and help stop this bill today. Your state senator is on a key committee that will vote on this bill within the next two days. That's why it's urgent that you leave a message for Senator orge hin to vote against SB6457, the tobacco regulation bill. I£ you'd like to call and leave that message right now, I cen connect you directly inte the senator's office _ and at no cost to you. Is that OK?

Sterling pate, September 28, 1995 re: SYNDICATED MAGAZINE RESEARCH This is a follow-up to my memo of September 27th. ‘The comparison I was suggesting for the data on Read 4 out of 4 issues was really not the best comparison. The charts attached are better comparisons for you to use. ‘The first chart called ""Loyalty of Audience"" compares the percent of total audience that reads 4 out of 4 to readers under 18 years that read 4 out of 4. This shows that in most cases a higher percentage of older readers are core or loyal versus under 18 years. ‘The second chart shows the total audience that reads 4 out of 4 issues and what percent of them are under 18. ‘These charts may be useful in establishing the fact that there are a lot of ‘occasional readers in the under 18 group. ‘The last chart lists magazine coverage of under 18, For example Better Homes and Gardens covers only 9.45% of teens. This could be another way of looking at the data that may be useful. Please let me know if you have any questions.

PUBLICITY RECORD New York, New York May 23, 1955 CIGARETTES ON UP-BEAT AGAIN ‘The relationship between cigarette smoking and lung cancer is as ob- scure as before the big storm blew up over a year ago, according to Dr, Clarence Cook Little, chairman of the scientific advisory board of the ‘Tobacco Research Industry Commlt- tee. Since there are so many pos sible causes of cancer, it Is pos sible that no one element, such as ‘Some found in cigarettes, might ever be blamed as a positive, unfailing cause. As far as the American pub- Uc is concerned, It seems to concur because cigarette sales have partial- ly retaken the helghts they had a. couple of years ago. Like anybody who isn’t sure, but is willing to be cautious, a large segment of the population has shifted to fitertip cigarettes. In the long drive by the cigarette manufacturers to regain their position against the orlginal “moral’”-medical attack on smokin promotion of all types has played a major part. Originally only one side was heard from and the cigarette makers were in a disorganized re- treat, the public had to go alongwith ‘medical opinion. As soon as the positive voice of “maybe, but no fone really knows"" wan heard, then the public started to look’ more closely at the situation. Also, peoples"" habits are pernicious; they may oe subdued, but they are never really eradicated. Effective promo- ton brought home to people the post- tive element of doubt, positive from the viewpoint of the cigarette people, because even Dr. Little pointe out that no one knows as yet. A bit of proof for special situa tions that sometimes a quick retort can be worse than the temporary no defense at all. The cigarette people took too long @ time to make up their minds, but the element thot bas worked, based on medical facts, is “no one really knows.” ‘THE LOUISVILIE TIMES Louisville, Kentucky Mey 17, 1955 COR TI 15539",9

Marritt COMPLETION DATE: April 25, 1986 1, INTRODUCTION ‘As part of the investigation of wrinkled cigarettes, samples of product were taken at Whitaker Park and inspected for wrinkles.! These samples were taken of Winston Light 100’s from 4 MK- 9/AMF's and from 3 Protos/GD's. The purpose of these samples was 1. to estimate the extent of the wrinkling problem 2, to estimate the importance of various sources of variability 8, to get a rough estimate of differences between the ‘MK-9/AMF and the Protos/GD. ton Light 100's because it is the brand etyle with the best mix of ‘MK-9/AMF""'s and Protos/GD's. Samples were taken from the maker mass flow (100 cigarettes) and from the packer (6 packs). The data was gathered under the direction of Roy Foster an Dave Robertson. This report summarizes the findings from those samples. ‘Samples were taken from Wit A listing of the data that was gathered is given in Table 1. The values at the maker are the number of wrinkled cigarettes from a sample of 100 and the values at the packer are the number of wrinkled cigarettes per pack. A summary of the data is given in Table 2. We note several things from Table 2. 1, There are few wrinkled cigarettes at the maker. 2. There is a considerably larger number of wrinkles at the packer. 3. There is considerable machine-to-machine variation, 4. The proportion of wrinkles at the Protos/GD is less than at the MK-9/AMF. That difference, as we note below, is not statistically significant; however, it is based on a emall sample of machines and further eampling may show the observed differences to be “real.” (Note that, the machine with the second fewest wrinkled cigarettes is a MK-9/AMF machine.) 5. There is a problematically large number of wrinkles from both the Protos/GD and the MK- 9/AMF machines. 2. ANALYSIS Firet we examine the wrinkles at the packer. ‘This is to quantify the several componente of variance. The results of the analysis are summarized in Table 3. Table 3 shows that we cannot conclude that the Protos/GD is significantly different from the MK-9/AMF. However, there is a difference between machines and there is a difference from sample time to sample time within a machine, All 3 sources of variation look to be of comparable size. T As defined by the Wrinkled Cigarette working committee, a wrinkle is a transverse indentation around one-half or more of the cigarette. 1ee7s 6ese",0

"The Scare— and Diversification - By FELIX F, FLUSS Daa, RYN be who analyses the U.S. manufacturers’ growing tendency to branch out into non-tobacco enterprises HE R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, the biggest cigarette maker of the U.S., announced recently that it hat acquired Pacific Havaiian Products Co, a maker of cake mixes, fruit beverages and shoe- shine kits. Behind this move and other cigarette makers’ expansion of their rnon-tobacco activities are, according to the opinion of several financial analysts, some disquieting statistics, In 1962 the annual increase of cigarette consumption was the smallest since 1954. According to estimates, per-capita consumption has remained at the same level as in 1961. This contrasts with an average growth rate fof approximately 3} packs a person ‘each year from 1957 through 1961. Industrial observers claim that with this move another episode has been closed in the struggle of the U.S. tobscco industry to combat adverse publicity linking cigarette smoking with lung cancer and other diseases: Although it has been pointed out that Reynolds’ would probably hesitate to connect its diversification programme with fear for the smoking habit, it has been claimed that over the past Year or 40, and not least tince the publication in March, 1962, of the unfavourable British report on “Smoking and Health”, evidence has been mounting in the U.S. against cigarette smoking as a health hazard, In June, 1954, the American Cancer Society published a study showing certain statistical correlations between smoking and lung cancer. This was taken up by the popular Press and for the first time a “cancer scare” ensued which was reflected in a decline jn smoking that year. In the meantime the American public has repeatedly been exposed to the question of the relationship between Gigarette smoking and lung cancers 1 few weeks ago the public once again hhas been confused by conflicting ements by the American Cancer Society and the Tobacco Institute, the organisation of the U.S. tobacco industry, which through its ‘Tobacco Research: Committee sponsors a pro- ‘gramme of research into questions of Tobacco use and health. So. far $6,250,000 have been appropriated for this purpose. However, the Surgeon General of the United States last October appoin- ted a committee of leading scientists in order to obtain “a comprehensive review ofall available data on smoking and other factors in the environment that may affect health”; intimating that the public should wait until the committee presents its findings, prob- ably this summer. In 1929 Reynolds bought for a very modest. sum’ the Tin-Foil Rolling Company, now the Archer Aluminum Division. This division supplies vireu- ally all Reynolds’ foil. requirements and performs all the foil and paper colour printing. Ic sells its surplus to third parties, both inside and outside the industry. Indeed the company believes itis an important factor in the foil market During the last 10 years or so the use of aluminium foil for frozen food, for broiling and many other cooking and household purposes in the U.S. thas increased at a rapid rate. The main ‘outlets—food stores and supermarkets ‘sell packaged aluminium fol in large amounts; Reynolds has secured a sizeable shate of this market, In 1958, 185,511 short tons of aluminium fol valued at $140.5 million have been, shipped. In 1960 the value of ship- ments rose to $179.4 million. The 1961 production of the entire U.S. foilgy industry amounted to $187.7 million. ‘To meet the increased demandty Archer Aluminum Division is presently expanding the capacity of the factory by so per cent. Reynolds hopes t0 increase its proportion of sales to outside customers, now about 25 per cent. Philip Morris Inc. acquired Milprint Inc., a leading convertor of flexible packaging; a subsidiary, the Nicolet Paper Company, nicely rounded out of the line of packaging material, Sales ‘of Milprint and its subsidiary, Nicolet Paper Company, increased considerably last year; in order to meet the increased demand for its specialty papers, Nicolet last November started an expansion Programme in West DePere (Wis consin). Two buildings are in the process of being constructed and special, new machinery designed for the manufacture of glassine, grease- Proof and specialty papers has been ordered. A new supercalender for making glassine and a water treating. plant will be instrumental for an efficient production of top grade merchandise. Philip Morris acquired Polymer Industries, Inc., a producer of synthetic resin emulsions. ‘This company will build a new, modern reactor plant for the production of emulsion polymers on a 27-acre site near Greenville (North Carolina). This new facility, scheduled for completion late this yeat, reflects the growing demand for many textile yarn preparation and fin'shing products; it points to the growing position of the company in the produc- tion of textile chemicals R. J. Reynolds installed the Hunter ‘continuous casting process, whereby 4 in. aluminium sheet is’ produced directly from molten metal and rolled down into foil immediately, Further [progress in the functional uses of foil— plain, aminated or coloured—have ‘been made. ‘The operations are now integrated with the installation of the latest laminating, foil and paper colour printing and roto-gravure presses down, to the final product. As a, result, Reynolds is already selling packaging material to many more industries at an increasing rate. ‘A different kind of diversification ‘move has been made in 1960 by acquir- ing 8 51 per cent, interest in Haus 2 ah",9

The vast majority of studies used a surrogate for ETS ‘exposure (meialy paternal smoking), without verification of such exposure ‘with e biochemical marker. Toe sample sizes of the studies ranged from under 100 subjects to almost 25,000 subjects. Most studies employed regression snalysis. A considerable variation from study to study was noted in the weat- ‘ment of potential confounding variables and most stidies considered relative- 1y few of these. Most ofthe individual confounding variables were considered {na relatively small proportion (one third or less) of the srudies. The majority (Gimost two thirds) of the studies failed to demonstrate a statistically signif cant association between ETS exposure of the pregcant woman and low birth- ‘weight. This general leck of consistency of association could reflet absence of an adverse effect of ETS or methodologic difficulties such as misclassification ‘error, type Tl error, recall bias, o inadequate adjustment for potential con- ature, it was concluded at the time that there was litde’ evidence of such an association.

Despite the tight budget caps in place and Attomey General Janet ‘Reno’s 1997 admission to the Senate Judiciary Committee that “the federal government does not have an independent cause of action [against the tobacco companies,]” the Justice Department has asked for $20 million to pursue its lawsuit. In response to questions submitted by Senator McConnell earlier this veer, the Justice Department indicated it was committed to pursuing this case regardless of whether Congress approves the $20 million budget request for the lawsuit. ‘The Appropriations Committee's Commerce, Justice, State and Judiciary Subcommittee denied the Justice Department's request for funding to bring the lawsuit and included language to prohibit any significant reprogramming of funds. No effort was made atthe full committee to change these provisions. Congress should reject any attempt on the floor to add funding for this lawsuit or to allow the Justice Department to reprogram funds. Enclosed is an analysis by CSE’s educational affiliate, CSE Foundation, that details why the Clinton administration has no valid legal claim to “recoup” money from the tobacco industry. According to The Wall ‘Street Journal, applying any of the statutes the administration has discussed relying on “would require leaps of logic and backdoor strategies that offend the legal sensibilities of some career Justice Department lawyers” (May 27, 1999, p.

The moleculesthat determine the Band T cal devel ‘opmental pathways are largely unknown. However, the regulation of immunoglobulin and T cell receptor (TCR) {gene expression has boon extonsvoly studio’ and hes been shown to be dependent on various sequence ele- ‘ments present in both the immunoglobulin and TCR gone ‘enhancers Ferrior ot al., 1990; Lonardo etal, 1987; Sen and Balimore, 1986; Takeda et al., 1990; Tsao etal 1988). One class of such sits. the E box elements, has Deen particularly well studiod and shares @ consensus sequence of GCAGXTG (Church etl, 1985; Ephrussi al, 1985). The proteins that bind to the E box elements have recently boon identified and belong to a family of DNA-binding proteins, designated as helictoop-helo (HLH) proteins (Mure etal, 1994). These proteins share arogion ‘of homology in the basic helix-loop-helix domain anc theit DNA-binding and dimerization domains (Mure et a 1989a, 1994), Severalofthe class HLH proteins have been implicated In the regulation of immunoglobulin gene expression. In re-B, mature B, and plasma cells, tissue-specific com plexes are present that bind to the wE2, wES, ues, xE, ‘and xE2 sites present in the immunoglobulin heavy and light chain gene enhancers (Bain etal, 1993: Jacobs » 1993; Murre et al. 1991). At the pre-B cel stage, it is ‘redominantly E2-2, andtoa lesser degroe E2A, that binds {o the E box sites (Bain etal, 1993). However, during the pre-B to mature B coll ansiton, E2-2 protein levels drop ‘and E2A levels increase. At the mature B col stage iis predominantly E2A that binds tothe E box sites (Bain et al, 1993). Further evidence that E2A products might be involved in regulating Immunoglobulin gene expression ‘comes from studies in which overexpression of E47 in re-T calls leads to induction of garmin immunoglobulin. hheavy chain gone expression, immunoglobulin OJ re- arrangement, and increased levels of Oct-2 and RAG gene ‘expression (Schiissol otal, 19918). In addition, vere ‘ression of £47 induces immunoglobulin enhancer activity in non-B cells (Ruezinsky et a, 199%). ‘The function of E2A molecules in other developmental pathwaysisless clear.

Richter “Walther Steaub-tnstvt far Pharmakologie und Tontkologie der Ludwig-Maximilians- Universit, MGnchen, Geemany Abstract: Nicotine and its major metabolite coti- fine inhibit a-hydroxylation of the tobacco-specif- ic nitrosamine 4-methylnitrosamino)-1-G-pyridyD- L-butanone (NNK) suggesting that an alternative pathway of NNK metabolism and elimination, bit- lary exeretion of the O-glucuronide of 4-(methyl- nitrosamino)-1-G-pyridyl)-L-butanol_ (NNAL-Gluc) ‘may be enhanced. To verify the possible role of cotinine on biliary elimination of NK and its me- tabolites, bile duct cannulated rats were adminis- tered a Single ip. dose of 50 mg/kg [5-2HI-NNK with or without ip. co-administration of 5 mg/kg. cotinine or nicotine. Cotinine significantly re~ duced cumulative bile flow and biliary elimination of NNK-derived radioactivity within six hours to, 42 and 27 percent, respectively. The pattern of NNK metabolites in bile was unchanged. Nicotine | had 2 similar inhibitory effect on bile flow. This, | result constitutes the first experimental evidence that cotinine inhibits bile flow. In rats, biliary elimination of NNK is reduced accordingly which, i may lead to an increased carcinogen burden in the body. In humans, inhibition of bile flow by to- bacco alkaloids may contribute to the appetite suppressing effect of tobacco products. | @ inactivation | maar ghee gtr okr-ot Fig. 1.

Morris, MD, PhD, Anne-Marie Audet, MD, MS, Italo F. Angelillo, DDS, MPH, Thomas C. Chalmers, MD, and Frederick Mosteller, PhD Introduction After its fist use inthe Chicago stock- yards in 1908, chlorination of drinking water spread rapidly throughout the United States and produced dramatic reductions in mor- bidity and morality associated with water- bbome diseas.! Since then, chlorine has re- ‘mained the method of choice for water purification; itis currently added to approx: ‘mately 5% ofthe nation’s drinking water? In 1974, Rook? discovered that the combi nation of chlorine with organic compounds. in drinking water produced halogenated or- ‘ganic compounds—chioroform, in paricu- Tar. In 1975, the National Organics Recon- naissance Survey verified that chlorination by-products were a major contaminant of chlorinated surface water. The study also showed that chloroform concentration cor- relates highly with the concentrations of ‘other halogenated hydrocarbons and is, therefore, a useful indicator forthe presence ‘of these compounds. Since this finding, a plethora of epidemiological studies* have investigated possible associations between ‘consumption of chlorinated water and can- ‘er. These studies conser a wide range of populations and regions and demonstrate somewhat inconsistent pattems of associa- tion. We used metacanalytic methods to pool the results of these studies in an at- tempt to funher our understanding of the relationship berween water chlorination and neoplastic diseases. Meta-analysis provides greater statistical power and greater resolu- ‘ion inthe estimation of relative risks than so individual studies. Methods Identifcation of Relevant Studies To identify references pertaining to the relationship between chlorination of drinking water and neoplastic diseases, ‘we used the Medline data retrieval system to search the medical, public health, and biological literature from 1966 through 1991. Relevant papers were obtained and reviewed to locate additional references. ‘Because intial analyses suggested an as- sociation between chlorination and both bladder and rectal cancer, the Medline system was used to conduct a second search of the literature over the same 25- year period for papers that considered these neoplasms and mentioned water in the tile, abstract, or keywords. Only those studies that identified morbidity or mortality as well as exposure land potential confounders at the level of the individual (,e., case-control or cohort studies) were included in the meta-analy sis, Studies that considered incidence and ‘exposure at the level ofa region or com ‘munity (Le., ecological studies) were ex: cluded.

From this analysis we calculate that the total number of expressed Vp gene segments may be 21 or fewer, which makes the expressed germline V, repertoire much smaller than that of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain or ligh-chain aenes. We suggest that B-chain somatic diversification is concentrated at the Vj-Dg-Jp junctions BOTH the Ticell receptor and the immunoglobulins are heterogeneous cell-surface glycoproteins that can recognize many antigens’. It is clear ftom genomic analysis that they share similar strategies for diversification, “T-cell receptor molecules are composed of o- and B-chains, each of which, like the immunoglobulin chains, is divided into variable (V) and constant (C) regions», The V regions together form the antigen- binding domain.

Unexpectedly, both mutations created v-s7¢ alleles that transform chicken cells with wild-type (wt) efficiency and are reduced for transformation of rat cells; these alleles are host dependent for transformation. Addition- ally, these alleles resulted in a round morphological transformation of chicken cells, Unlike 12 of the 13 known hostdependent fre SED mutations that result in a fusiform morphology. Analysis of phosphopeptide binding by the mutant SH2 domains reveal that the in vitro ability to bind phosp! peptides known to have a high afnty for wt are SH2 correlates with wt (round) morphological transformation in chicken cells and the in vitro ability to bind phosphopeptides known to have a low alfnty for wt sre SH2 correlates with rat cell transformation. These results suggest that the search for critical substrates in rat cells should be among proteins that interact with pp60""*"" with low delete delete syntal affinity. INTRODUCTION ‘The cellular protein tyrosine kinase p60"" has been strongly implicated in human colon carcinogenesis olen etal, 1987; Cartwright eta, 1990, 1991; Garcia etal, 1991; Novotnysmith and Gallick, 1992). The ret- roviral oncoprotein pp60""*"", a mutated counterpart of chicken pp60"""", has long been used as a model sys- tem for understanding neoplastic transformation and is capable of transforming avian or rodent fibroblasts to a neoplastic phenotype (Wyke and Stoker, 1987; Parsons and Weber, 1988). Studies on a large collec- tion of mutant alleles clearly reveal that tyrosine Kinase activity is necessary but not sufficient for trans- formation (Parsons and Weber, 1989). Despite inten- (©1997 by The American Society for Cell Biology 50735052 sive efforts, a complete understanding of the biochem- {cal mechanism of transformation by pp60°* is still lacking. Nonetheless it is clear that in addition to the catalytic domain pp60""** contains several other well- defined domains that make critical contributions to transformation. The extreme N terminus of pp60"""" contains the tmyristylation domain (also known as src homol domain 4; Resh, 1993) that is responsible for the post- translational addition of the 14-carbon fatty acid my- ristate to the glycine at position 2 (Kamps et al, 1985). This fatty acid plus nearby acidic amino acids (iver. ‘man and Resh, 1992) form a membrane-binding do- ‘main that is essential for transformation by pp60""*” (Buss et al, 1986; Kamps et al, 1986). p60"" also 1",6

"Holiday Season Activities PM Cabarrus 1994 LLEE. Center Jean Crabill of Corporate Affairs and June Benfield of Primary Processing coordinated entertainment for the L.LF.E, Center Christmas Party and collected money plantwide to purchase each participant a poinsettia. Other employees participating were Vicky Pickard, Kathy Waters, Mike Cannaday, Dee Ellison, June Moose, Joanne Simpson, Floyce Harward and Gwen Hester, L.LF-E. is an acronym for Living Interest for Elderly. This is a non-profit program serving older adults and their families throughout Cabarrus County. Salvation Army Members of the Primary Processing and ET Departments assisted in providing volunteers from the PM workforce to participate in the Salvation Army Kettle Program. Ninety employees donated a total of 98.5 hours of personal time to this project. Monty Matthews, Manager of Primary Processing, is a member of the Advisory Board for the Salvation Army. Church of God Orphanage For the past three years, the Philip Morris Cabarrus Expansion Project Team and Fluor Daniel employees have sponsored ""Operation Our Kids."" This is in support of the Cabarrus County Church of God Orphanage, Each month project team members have provided a birthday party for the children at the orphanage. This party was complete with birthday presents selected for each child, a decorated birthday cake, ice cream, soft drinks and balloons. Project team members took the party supplies to the orphanage every month and celebrated with all the children. During the three years, they also provided money to pay for a chartered bus for the kids and house parents to travel to Disney World; renovated condemned playground equipment; and shared picnics with the house parents and children, For Christmas, gifts were provided for all the children as well as special presents for the entire home such as encyclopedias, CD Rom games and educational software, With the ""winding down"" of the Cabarrus Expansion project, they will not be having birthday parties in 1995. On Tuesday, December 13, members of the project team took their last gifts to the orphanage. They presented staff members and maintenance personnel at the home with potted plants; house parents and staff were given gift certificates; and the home was presented a check for $1200 to use toward whatever they deemed necessary.

These results suggest that nicotine ‘may be acting on cortical mechanisms involved in veual perception and atterton, and support {he hypothesis that acetycholine transmission modulates viglance and discrimination, Nicotine ‘may therefore be of some value in treating deficits in attention and information processing in DAT patients ‘The cholinergic hypothesis of ageing and dementia attributes impairment of memory and cognition to ‘reduced central cholinergic function (Drachman & Sahakian, 1979; Bartus er ai, 1982; Sahakian, 1988). Critical evidence for this hypothesis isthe finding thatthe degree of cognitive impairment in patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) is positively correlated with decrease of choline acetyltransferase, and a reduction in acetylcholine (ACH) syathess in brain, measured in post-mortem and biopsy studies respectively (Perry et al, 1978; Francis eta, 1985). In addition, both muscarinic and nicotine receptors in cerebral cortex are decreased in normal elderly subjects, and may be still further reduced in the brains of patients with DAT (White et al, 1977; Davies & Feisullin, 1981; Rinne ef a, 1984; Flynn & Mash, 1985; Candy et al, 1986). Tt may therefore be possible to improve partially the impairment in memory and cognitive function ‘of DAT patients with a cholinergic receptor agonist, such as nicotine. Nicotine, in addition to its post- synaptic action, may also act pre-synaptically, since there is evidence for presynaptic nicotinic auto- receptors promoting ACh release (Rowell & Winkler, 1984; Clarke et a, 1986). The purpose of this study ‘was (o investigate whether nicotine could enhance performance on computerised tests of attention, information processing, and short-term memory in ‘normal elderly subjects and patients with DAT. Method ‘There were three groups: 7 young normal adults (@ men, women, mean age 27 (£8.00 yet, dames); 7 elderly ‘ormal contol subjects (6 men, 1 woman, mean age 70 (2526 years, smokers; and 7 patients with DAT G men, 44 women, mean age 71 (46.02) years, 3 smokers). The 797 National Adult Reading Test (Nelson, 1982) was used to match the thre groups for pre-morbi verballQ, with scores ‘of 12, 120, and 119 respectively. The young adults were ‘tudens nd community vlunter, and the edely controls were community volunteers and the spouses of patents Patients had been asesied at he Matdsley Hospital Memory Clinie(Philpot Levy, 1987), and diagnosed by a consultant psychiatrist in concordance with a second pejhistrist a8 faving DAT following the criteria oulined for ‘probable Alzheimer's disease’ by Meihann el (1985). All patients Selected were considered to bein the mild or moderate stages ofthe disease, and fllin stages 1 or 2 the Clinial Dementia Rating Scale (Hughes ea, 1982) Although the numbers may appear smal, it should be empbasied that itis dificult o obtain erly, well-dagnosed eases of DAT, ‘and to match them so closely wit controls. ‘Subjects and patients attended ening sesions followed by seven test sesions inthe following order: an undrugged baseline sesion, a placebo sesion (saline), three sessions with nicotine (@.4mg, 0.6m, and 0.8 mg), 2 placebo session, and an undrugged baseline session.

However, irradiation of the N-methyl group at 2.13 ppm of nicotine in trifluoroacetic acid solution (TFA) did not cause an NOE on the pyridyl protons but rater on the C.2"" and C-8'9 protons. In TFA, the ate of deprotona (of nicotinium diacid salts is slow compared to the NMR time scale, and the peak at 3.13 ppm is attributed tothe ricotinivi salt a whieh the N-methyl group is trans to the pyridine ring.

It is estimated that nicotine-eee base exists with its ‘Nemethyl group preferentially (90.9 + 0.9%) trans to the pyridine ring by gas-phase kinetic quenching experiments, ‘The configuration! of nicotine and nicotine acid salts has been a topic of concern for many years."" Nicotine structural analysis indicates two unknown features: the orientation of the N-methyl group and the relative position of the pyridine and pyrrolidine rings. Experimental determination of these two structural parameters is complicated by the likelihood of ow enerzy barriers to change."" We now report the cesults of ‘our studies which show that the preferred (>30%) conti ration of the N-methyl group in nicotine is 1” (R) (ie, trans to the pyridine ring) under a variety of experimental condi- tions. Recently, Chynoweth, Ternai, Simeral, and MacielS con- cluded on the basis of their NMR studies of nicatine in CDCly land Ds0 “that the N-mathyl group is preferentially on the ‘same side of the pyrrolidine ring a8 the pyridine ring”. That conclusion’ contrasted with perturbative configuration in- teraction calculations performed by Pullman, Courriere, and Coubeils,7* which indicated that 1 (see Scheme I) was ap, proximately 4 kcal/mol more stable than 2.1! Other investi gators? based their configurational assignments on (1) steric evaluations using space-filling models or (2) demethylation studies of nicotine N’-oxide. Any conclusion based on these latter two criteria meets with severe criticism. Finally, Koo and Kira® have roported the x-ray analysis ofa crystal of ni= ‘cotine dihydriodide in which the N-methyl group was in a trana configuration with respect to the pyridine ring (ef. 3). However, the crystalline sample was undoubtedly prepared under conditions in which the equilibria shown in Scheme I were operative, and itis theoretically possible that a minor component, or one of a number of components, crystallized. In addition, conclusions based on x-ray data of a solid cannot necessarily be applied to the conformation or configuration, of the same molecule in solution, especially if protonation deprotonation reactions are occurring in solution.'* ~ > 1000769824",6

Lemmon* Department of Molecular Biology and Microbiology, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio 44105-1960 Submitted June 13, 1985; Novernber 15,195 “Monitoring Editor Randy W. Schekmaa, Clathrin and its associated proteins constitute a major class of coat proteins involved in vesicle budding during membrane transport. An interesting characteristic of the yeast clathrin heavy chain gene (CHC) is that in some strains a CHI deletion is lethal, while in others it is not. Recently, our laboratory developed a screen that identified five multicopy suppressors that can rescue lethal stains of clathrin heavy chain-defcient yeast (Chc™ scd1-i) to viability. One of these suppressors, SCDS, encodes a novel protein of 872 amino acids containing two regions of repeated motifs of unknown function. Deletion of SCDS has shown that it is essential for cell growth at 30°C. scd5-A strains carrying low copy plasmids encoding C-terminal truncations of Scd5p are temperature sensitive for growth at 37°C. At the nonpermissive temperature, cells expressing a 338-amino acid deletion (Scd5p-4338) accumulate an internal pool of fully glycosylated invertase and mature a-factor, while processing and sorting of the vacuolar hydrolase carboxypeptidase Y is normal. The truncation mutant also accumulates 80- to 100-nm. vesicles similar to many late sec mutants. Moreover, at 34°C, overexpression of Scd5p suppresses the temperature sensitivity of a sec2 mutant, which is blocked at a post-Golgi step of the secretory pathway. Biochemical analyses indicate that ~50% of ScdSp sedi- ments with a 100,000 x g membrane fraction and is associated as a peripheral membrane protein. Overall, these results indicate that ScdSp is involved in vesicular transport at a late stage of the secretory pathway. Furthermore, this suggests that the lethality of clathrin-deficient yeast can be rescued by modulation of vesicular transport at this late secretory step. ° INTRODUCTION The transfer of proteins along the secretory and endo- ytic pathways occurs by vesicular transport. The for- mation of transport vesicles involves the recruitment of coat proteins to the cytoplasmic face of the mem- brane to facilitate budding. In addition, such coat pro- teins can mediate the selection of vesicle cargo. A number of different types of coated vesicles have been characterized including clathrin-coated vesi- cles (Pearse and Robinson, 1990), COP-coated vesi- cles (Rothman and Orci, 1992), and COPII-coated vesicles (Barlowe et al, 1994).

In addition, they are involved in sorting of lysosomal hydrolases via mannose-6-phosphate receptors from the trans-Golgi network to a pre-lysosomal compartment (Campbell and Rome, 1983; Brown and Farquhar, 1984) and they are involved in the formation of secretion granules, eg. in hormone or neuropeptide-secreting cells (Tooze and Tooze, 1986; Burgess and Kelly, 1987). Although most early information on clathrin coat protein structure and function was derived from bio- chemical and cytological studies using animal cells in the last several years yeast has provided genetic ap- proaches to the study of the clathrin-mediated vesic- ular transport machinery.

Approximately 27% of those with bloody diarthca were hospitalized, 89% developed systemic complications. and four children died (8). A common his- topathological finding in patients with postdiarrheal sequelae is the destruction of endothelial cclls lining small blood vessels in the colon, kidneys, and central nervous system (26). In vivo studies using a number of animal models demonstrated that purified Shiga toxin ancl SITs cause vascular damage in many of the samme target organs (for a review, see reference 9). In vitro studies utilizing human vascular endothelial cells (HVEC) from a numberof sites demonstrated a direct cytopathic effect ‘mediated by the toxins, although in Some cases, the toxin co- centrations necessary to manifest cytotoxicity were orders of ‘magnitude greater than that estimated to be circulating in the bloodstream of infected patients (23, 33).

Kobal Dose-dependent stereoselective activation of the trigeminal sensory system by nicotine in man Received: 16 March 1998/Final version: 14 September 1998 Abstract Rationale: Nicotine applied to the nasal cav- ity can evoke ‘odorous’ sensations in the concentration range near the detection threshold by the activation of the olfactory sensory system and at higher concentra- tions ‘burning’ and ‘stinging’ sensations by the dose- dependent recruitment of C- and Aé-fibers of the trigeminal sensory system. Neuronal nicotinic acetyl- choline receptor (nAchR) subunits are expressed in trigeminal primary afferents and could constitute the receptors involved in nicotine perception. Objective: In the present study, we dose-dependently investigated the stereoselective effects of RCH)- and S(— the trigeminal and olfactory sensory system in man. ‘Methods: Trigeminal detection thresholds forthe ‘burn ing’ and “stinging” sensations and the olfactory detec- tion threshold for the ‘odorous’ sensation were determined. In order to quantify trigeminal activation, wwe recorded summated electrical responses from the respiratory nasal mucosa during stimulation with R(+)- ‘and S(—)-nicotine vapor (40, 80, 120, 160 ng/ml; stim: ulus duration: 250 ms), In addition, subjects rated the intensity of ‘odorous’, “burning” and ‘stinging’ sensa- tions. For chemical stimulation with nicotine enan- tiomers, a vapor-cilution olfactometer (constant flow rate: 140 ml/s, humidity: 80%, temperature: 37°C, stimulus duration 250 ms) was employed, Results: We found significant stereoselective differences for the trigeminal but not for the olfactory system, i.e. higher summated responses, higher trigeminal intensity esti- mates, and lower trigeminal detection thresholds for N.

Key words Nicotine  Stereoisomers - Sensory ‘Trigeminal - Olfaction - Pain Introduction Stercospecific binding of nicotine enantiomers has been demonstrated for high and low affinity binding sites in the central nervous system, and in the periphery for binding sites at the nicotinic receptor of the autonomic and the somatic nervous systems (Melzer et al, 1980; Romano and Goldstein 1980; Martin and Accto 1981; Tkushima et al. 1982; Abood et al. 1985; Sloan ct al 1985; Accto et al. 1986; Henley and Oswald 1987; Goldberg et al. 1989). The quantitative differences in binding values (ICs) of nicotine enantiomers seem to be small compared to the differences observed for the stereoisomers of opioids. Abood et al. (1985) found a threefold greater ICsy value for R(+)-nicotine than for ‘S(~-nicotine at the higher affinity site and twioe that atthe lower affinity site. The affinity of opioids to the ul-receptor was 10-fold higher for RC) than for ‘S(--}rmethadone (Kristensen et al. 1995), It has been shown in Dreiding models that the nitrogen atoms of the nicotine stereoisomers are nearly superimposable (Aceto et al. 1986), thus explaining the small stereo- Selective diferences using the simplicity of the nicotine molecule.

"| Some straight talk about smoking for young people. We're R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, and we're urging you not to smoke. We're saying this because, throughout the world, . smoking has always been an adult custom. And é because today, even among adults, smoking is controversial. Your first reaction might be to ignore this advice. Maybe you feel we're talking to you as if you were a child. And you probably don’t think of yourself that way. But just because you're no longer a child doesn’t mean you're already an adult. And if you take up smoking just to prove you're not a kid, you're kidding yourself. Soplease don’t smoke. You'll have plenty of time as an adult to decide whether smokingis right for you. “hats about as straight as we can putit. 50530 0914 R.J_Reynolds Tobacco Company",4
