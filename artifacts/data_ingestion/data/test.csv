february 16 2000 mr brad timbes chevron in response to the questions relayed to us by our sales department id like to give you more information about camels new “pleasure to burn” advertising campaign ‘the “pleasure to burn” campaign is a wellrounded campaign that accurately depicts “the old and new” by mixing contemporary and classic with alittle bit of fun it celebrates the heritage of the camel brand yet is relevant to today its also an excellent display for retail given its vibrant colors and simple visuals ‘the “pleasure to bum” ads capitalize on the fact that camel holds a unique position as a cigarette brand which has a rich heritage but also keeps up with the times the campaign celebrates the decades of camels popularity  reflecting different cultural periods and tastes in our society — but also brings the ads up to date by juxtaposing elements of past eras and contemporary cues at first glimpse the ads appear to have a retro feel but a second look reveals utterly modern elements for example a male detective wears a classic hat and trench coat but sports an earring and a lady reminiscent of past eras chats on a cell phone the ads are designed to stand out and deliver a telegraphic and impactful message it offers us a highly branded format but in a classic painting style that feels more like art than advertising the format is designed to translate easily and impactfully to many different media and applications — a variety of sizes shapes formats and locations for example the graphics would work in a magazine ad a bar sign a directmail piece or in retail display it is important to us in developing advertising that we not only clearly communicate the brands message in a distinctive way but we emphasize being sensitive to how consumers might perceive the ad all of our advertising concepts are presented to an in house “advertising review panel” to get reactions from average employees who work in various departments outside our sales and marketing areas and tested with consumer focus groups consumer testing showed that the “pleasure to burn” ads had very broad appeal among adult smokers of all ages and both genders in focus groups among male and female adult smokers ranging in age from 21 to fifties the “pleasure to burn” ads got an overwhelmingly positive response from both males and females they described the ads as “fun” “upbeat” nostalgic yet contemporary  the elements that capture camels personality and image an article in the new york times september 22 described the “pleasure to burn” ads as “a playful commemoration of the camel brand’s history” enclosed are samples of some ads from the “pleasure to burn” campaign rjr0000001241009542 70059 8335 e20l 19les,2

the scare— and diversification  by felix f fluss daa ryn be who analyses the us manufacturers’ growing tendency to branch out into nontobacco enterprises he r j reynolds tobacco company the biggest cigarette maker of the us announced recently that it hat acquired pacific havaiian products co a maker of cake mixes fruit beverages and shoe shine kits behind this move and other cigarette makers’ expansion of their rnontobacco activities are according to the opinion of several financial analysts some disquieting statistics in 1962 the annual increase of cigarette consumption was the smallest since 1954 according to estimates percapita consumption has remained at the same level as in 1961 this contrasts with an average growth rate fof approximately 3 packs a person ‘each year from 1957 through 1961 industrial observers claim that with this move another episode has been closed in the struggle of the us tobscco industry to combat adverse publicity linking cigarette smoking with lung cancer and other diseases although it has been pointed out that reynolds’ would probably hesitate to connect its diversification programme with fear for the smoking habit it has been claimed that over the past year or 40 and not least tince the publication in march 1962 of the unfavourable british report on “smoking and health” evidence has been mounting in the us against cigarette smoking as a health hazard in june 1954 the american cancer society published a study showing certain statistical correlations between smoking and lung cancer this was taken up by the popular press and for the first time a “cancer scare” ensued which was reflected in a decline jn smoking that year in the meantime the american public has repeatedly been exposed to the question of the relationship between gigarette smoking and lung cancers 1 few weeks ago the public once again hhas been confused by conflicting ements by the american cancer society and the tobacco institute the organisation of the us tobacco industry which through its ‘tobacco research committee sponsors a pro ‘gramme of research into questions of tobacco use and health so far 6250000 have been appropriated for this purpose however the surgeon general of the united states last october appoin ted a committee of leading scientists in order to obtain “a comprehensive review ofall available data on smoking and other factors in the environment that may affect health” intimating that the public should wait until the committee presents its findings prob ably this summer in 1929 reynolds bought for a very modest sum’ the tinfoil rolling company now the archer aluminum division this division supplies vireu ally all reynolds’ foil requirements and performs all the foil and paper colour printing ic sells its surplus to third parties both inside and outside the industry indeed the company believes itis an important factor in the foil market during the last 10 years or so the use of aluminium foil for frozen food for broiling and many other cooking and household purposes in the us thas increased at a rapid rate the main ‘outlets—food stores and supermarkets ‘sell packaged aluminium fol in large amounts reynolds has secured a sizeable shate of this market in 1958 185511 short tons of aluminium fol valued at 1405 million have been shipped in 1960 the value of ship ments rose to 1794 million the 1961 production of the entire us foilgy industry amounted to 1877 million ‘to meet the increased demandty archer aluminum division is presently expanding the capacity of the factory by so per cent reynolds hopes t0 increase its proportion of sales to outside customers now about 25 per cent philip morris inc acquired milprint inc a leading convertor of flexible packaging a subsidiary the nicolet paper company nicely rounded out of the line of packaging material sales ‘of milprint and its subsidiary nicolet paper company increased considerably last year in order to meet the increased demand for its specialty papers nicolet last november started an expansion programme in west depere wis consin two buildings are in the process of being constructed and special new machinery designed for the

27acre site near greenville north carolina this new facility scheduled for completion late this yeat reflects the growing demand for many textile yarn preparation and finshing products it points to the growing position of the company in the produc tion of textile chemicals r j reynolds installed the hunter ‘continuous casting process whereby 4 in aluminium sheet is’ produced directly from molten metal and rolled down into foil immediately further progress in the functional uses of foil— plain aminated or coloured—have ‘been made ‘the operations are now integrated with the installation of the latest laminating foil and paper colour printing and rotogravure presses down to the final product as a result reynolds is already selling packaging material to many more industries at an increasing

abstract tobacco plants were genetically transformed with the gene encoding hepatitis b surface antigen hbsag linked to a nominally constitutive promoter enzymelinked immunoassays using a monoclonal antibody directed against hboman serumderived hbsag revealed the presence of hbsag im extracts of transformed leaves at levels that correlated with ‘mrna abundance this suggests that there were no major ‘inherent limitations of transcription or translation of this foreign gene in plans recombinant hbsag was purified from ‘transgenic plants by immunoaffinity chromatography and ex amined by electron microscopy spherical particles with an average diameter of 22 nm were observed in negatively stained preparations sedimentation of transgenic plant extracts in swerose and cesium chloride density gradients showed that the recombinant hbsag and human seruoderived hbsag had similar physical properties because the hbsag produced in transgenic plants is antigenically and physically similar to the hbsag particles derived from human serum and recombinant ‘yeast which are used as vaccines we conclude that transgenic plants hold promise as lowcost vaceine production systems hepatitis b virus infection is one of the most widespread viral infections of humans and causes acute and chronic hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma 1 the infectious viral particle dane particle isa 43nm doubleshelled sphere that consists of a core containing the 32kilobase kb dna genome ‘bound to the core protein surrounded by the viral envelope containing phospholipids and the major surface antigen hep atitis b surface antigen hbsag 2 in addition to dane particles the serum of infected individuals also contains 22nm subbvral particles in great excess over virions these ‘noninfectious particles contain the elements of the viral envelope including the major 24kda peptide that occurs in alycosylated and unglycosylated forms 2 ‘because the host range of hepatitis b virus is limited to humans and chimpanzees and since the virus cannot be propagated in cell culture hbsag for use in vaccines was purified from the serum of infected ingividuals until a recom binant form rhbsag was produced in yeast 3 the immu nogenic yeastderived rhbsag occurs in the form of spher ical particles with an average diameter of 17 nm integration ‘of the peptides into the phospholipidcontaining particles greatly enhances their immunogenic properties 4 subse quent work showed that the peptides present in the yeast derived particles were much less extensively disulfidelinked than ia the human material but that such linking could be induced in vitro 5 intramuscular injection of serumderived hbsag or yeast derived rhbsag in healthy individuals results in effective immunization and protection from viral infection 6 7 in ‘many areas of the developing world however the expense of imanization programs for large segments of the population “the publication costs of his atte were defayed in part by page

attempt the expression of hbsag in plants vith the hope of developing a less expen sive production system further we hope to find a way to present the rhbsax in edible plant tissues in a form that ‘would be useful as un oral vaccine in this paper we describe the transformation of bacco withthe gene encoding hbsag and its expression in leaf tissue in the form of an antigenic spherical particle with an average diameter of 22 am this plantderived rhbsag is directly analogous to the rhbsag from yeast that is now used for commercial vaccines we view this as a successful first step in a longterm project dedicated to developing technologies for low cost “edible vaccines” for the developing work materials and methods construction of plasmids for plant transformation the hbsag coding region on

received for publieston april 23 1984 denise polacekt robert e byrne mary burrous and angelo m scanut§ from the departments of medicine and §biochemistry university of cheap pritzher schoo of medicine ‘chicago minois 60837 human highdensity lipoprotein class3 hdl was incubated with freshly isolated blood polymorphonu clear leukocytes pmn at 37 and 4 °c at both tem peratures the release of proteolytic activity pa caus ing the specific hydrolysis of apoaii was dependent on the concentration of hdl in the medium at 37°c the efflux of pa was linear and no saturation was reached up to an hdl protein concentration in the ‘medium of 800 ugml in turn at 4°c maximal pa release was reached at a concentration below 600 ug ml of hdl proteinml in the medium canine hdl ‘which contains apoai but not apoait was as effe tive as human hdl in promoting the release of pa from pmn this property was also exhibited by egg lecithineholesterol vesicles containing apoai at 4°c there was no strict correlation between efflux of pa affected by hdl and specific binding of iapo aihdl in competitive binding experiments a 50 fold excess of unlabeled hdl prevented more than 90 of the binding of iapoai hdls to pmn ‘whereas an excess of unlabeled lowdensity lipoprotein exhibited no effect when human hdl was incubated ‘with pmn at 4 or 37 °c and then subjected to ultracen trifugation at d 121 gml most of the pa that was initially associated with this lipoprotein was recovered in the bottom of the tube by gel filtration both pa and hdl were in the same peak ina low ionic strength buffer but were dissociated from each other by a high salt solution 4 121 gml we conclude that both ns urally occurring hdls and apoaistabilized lipid vesicles favor the release from pmn of an enzymatic activity which cleaves human apoaii this release appears to be dependent both on the interaction of the cells with the lipoprotein ligand and on the lipoprotein surface area acting as the acceptor for the enzyme probably through electrostatic forces early studies from this laboratory showed that when a mixed population of human blood leukocytes is incubated  this work was supported by united states

qxn 7s tot role of dna synthesis in secretion of immunoglobulin from murine b cells stimulated by t cell derived lymnphokines leigh g simpson ax peter c isakson from the department of pharmacology university of virgiula school of medicine charlottesvile va 22908 we have investigated whether cell division is re quired for induction of ig secretion from three types 4b cells which represent distinct activation states normal splenic b cells antilgtreated b ells and a monoclonal murine b cell tumor bcl1 polyclonal ig secretion was stimulated in vitro by 1psor by lymphokines produced by el4 cells el 4n which includes b cell growth factor 11 bcgf  lps and f14 sn were mitogenic for all three cell ‘pulations and stimulated substantial igm secre ion from both b cells and antilg blasts aphidi colin a reversible inhibitor of dna synthesis abol shed igm secretion from b cells and antitg blasts induced by either mitogen indicating that igsecret ing cells in these cultures are part of a cycling population bcl tumor cells respond to bcgf it but not to interleukin 2 or b cell stimulatory factor 1 with igm secretion and cell division allowing a direct assessment of the influence of bcgf ilstim ulated cell division on secretion of igm secretion by these cells during the first 24 hr of culture was not substantially affected by aphidicolin but secre tion at 48 or 72 hr was markedly inhibited culture of bcl cells for 48 hr with aphidicolin alone had no effect on cell viability or on subsequent respon siveness if the drug was removed eliminating non specific toxicity as an explanation of the drugs effect addition of aphidicolin during the last 24 hr of culture to either normal b cells or bcl cells was much less effective at inhibiting igm ‘secretion ‘these results indicate that the cells that secrete igm in response to bcgf il also synthesize dna when exposed to this factor thus induction of highrate ig secretion from murine b’cells by some stimuli including bcgf 11 may require at least one round of cell division during the course of an immune response in vivo b cells both proliferate and secrete immunoglobulin ig 1 tail the dependence of ig secretion upon cell division is tincertain initiation of cell division does not in itself activate ig secretion since some stimull are capable of inducing resting b cells to divide without secreting ig 2 4 this

exceptions the condvcting system contained less message than expected whereas the intrinsic cardiac ganglia contained more the mismatch between muscarinic recepior ‘and m2 mrna densities in the conducting system could not be ‘explained by the local expression of other muscarinic receptor genes since mi m3 and m4 mrnas were not detected at this uscarinic receptors located at a diversity of sites are known to contribute to the neuro regulation of cardiac fonction postjune tional cholinergic receptors on the myocardium have ‘been most thoroughly studied and can directly elicit negative chronotropic dromotropic or inotropic re sponses when uctivated by muscarinic agonists or the stimulation of cholinergic nerves muscarinic recep tors are also associated with cholinergic and adrenergic nerves in the heart these prejunctional receptors have an inhibitory influence on the release of acetyl choline and norepinephrine and presumably have a role in finetuning the amount of neurotransmitter available to interact with postjunctional receptors last musca rinic receptors are present on efferent neurons of the cardiac ganglia where they may have a role in modu lating ganglionic neurotransmission ‘an additional level of complexity has been added by the discovery of multiple muscarinic receptor subtypes five muscarinic receptor genes have been identified in molecular cloning experiments and the corresponding receptor proteins have been designated ml through m5 heterogeneity of muscarinic receptors has also been documented in functional and radioligand

what happens when cigarette smokers give up the habit do their chances of dying of pulmonary and cardiac diseases decrease do they lose various physical complaints evidence on these points is presented in this report and the evidence indicates that those who stop have a more favorable future and the longer they stop the better the outlook evidence on the effects of giving up cigarette smoking ecuyler hammond sed fapiha edence on the eles of ving wp smoking is more dificult to obtain than one might suppose we must first inquire why some habitual smokers give up the habit and whether once having stopped smoking they are likely to re sume the habit at a later date in a mail survey conducted in 1958 wwe asked excigarette smokers why they hhad stopped and whether they thought ving up the habit had any effect on their health or the way they felt ‘about 60 per cent said that they had stopped because of some physical com plaint such as cough chest or throat complaints loss of appetite stomach trouble or circulatory difficulties eighty two per cent of those who ssid that they had stopped because of a physical com plaint indicated some improvement such as less coughing as an apparent result of giving up the habit seventy four per cent of the men said that they gained weight table 1 shows the reasons for giving up smoking as stated by a sample of men between the ages of 50 and 69 who filled out questionnaires in late 1959 and early 1960 all of these men 602 had a history of only cigarette smoking and had stopped less than a year prior to answering the questionnaire about 17 per cent of them were “sick at pres  over half of those who were sick that they quit smoking because of some illness of physical complaint and over threequarters of those who were not “sick at present” gave the same sort of reasons the most frequently stated reasons were “doctors orders” heart and circulatory diseases and pul monary complaints such as cough fu sinus trouble and other respiratory con ditions ‘two years after enrollment in a pro spective epidemiological study surviving subjects were requested to fill out a second questionnaire they were asked whether they had been hospitalized and whether they had any serious diseases since enrolling in the study they were ‘also asked how many cigarettes they currently smoked per day ‘the data shown in table 2 are con fined to male subjects between the ages ‘of 50 and 69 who were smoking ciga rettes regularly when enrolled in the study tt shows the per cent who were vol 55 no 5 ajph 0 a proeot,6

secondhand smoke ts clear the air can cigarette smoke in the air cause disease in nonsmokers thatsan emotional question for smokers and nonsmokers alike sowell try to set the record straight in the most direct way we know there is little evidence—and certainly nothing which proves scientifically—that cigarette smoke causes disease among non smokers  youdont have to take our word for it us surgeon general julius b richmond—who was no friend of smoking—said in his 1979 report “healthy nonsmokers exposed to cigarette smoke have little or no physiologic response to the smoke and what response does occur may be due to psychological factors” andin the 1982 report surgeon general c everett koop could not conclude that passive smoking is a cause of cancer in non smokers the director of the national heart lung and blood institute dr claude lenfant has been one of the tobacco industry’ sharpest  critics yet dr lenfant stated in 1980 and we believe it remains true today that “the evidence that passive smoking ina general environ ment has health effects remains sparse incomplete and sometimes unconvincing” weve decided to speak out on passive smoking because there is so much rumor and rhetoric on this subject today and we intend to continue from time to time to speak out on other topics of concer toyouand tous our critics may try to discredit these messages as selfserving ina sense they will be right we will challenge allegations that are unproven and attacks we think are unfounded if that is selfserving sobeit the questions that surround smoking raise many important issues we believe that youre entitled to hear all sides of these controversies me mnautnncoce rj reynolds tobacco company e202 z9005,4

country and abroad these four books provide use ful background material for the job ahead the british journalist peter taylor has produced a briskly written book which summarizes the major scientific ‘economic and political realities of the tobacco industry the book begins with ‘an account of the scientific evidence that cigarettes cause cancer heart dis case and emphysema and bronchitis he relates this with the story of how the deta emerged in the major public hncalth reports on smoking and with sev eral anecdotes about the tobacco indus try’s own research on the health effects ‘of

pro vides a valuable behind the scenes ac count of his own 1976 documentary death in the west this film contrasts the stories of six men from the ameri ‘ean west who developed major ciga

of the industrys tech nigues and approaches elizabeth whelan a public health worker i also concerned with the so cial political and economic aspects of the tobacco problem she shares with taylor the conviction that active sition from the tobacco industry and its supporters is the major reason that the abundant scientific evidence of harm from smoking has not yet led to effec tive control measures

too often a news story con taining “bad” news about tobacco and disease is “balanced” with distracting and evasive comments from the tobac co institute ‘the major portion of the book is de voted to an historical narrative about the problem this provides a useful overview for instance cigarettes only became widely available with the per fection of mass production machinery in 1884 mass production itself gener ated the need for mass promotion ciga rette advertising has been an important part of the industry for as long as cig tettes have been produced by machine finally the third portion of whelan’s book outlines a variety of actions and activities that can help reduce tobecco consumption the prescription is broad ‘and unfocused but this isthe state of the art what has been tried heretofore has produced few results determining the appropriate strategy and assem ing resources to implement it are the major challenges now facing public health whelan has summarized the problem and
