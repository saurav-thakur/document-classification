School boards in Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Atlanta and many other cites banned apples and apple products from their cafeterias. Some parents raced after their children’s school buses to yank apples ftom their lunch boxes. Supermarkets came under intense pressure to remove apples form their shelves. Uniroyat, the manufacturer of Alar; pulled the product off the market. Sales of apples plummeted, forcing many farm- ex to dump their erops or ive them away—costing the industry ‘more than $100 million, according to economists’ estimates. Reaction to the Alar scare ""set a troubling precedent,” the ‘Washington Post editorialized several weeks later. “A com cated scientific issuo was allowed to be decided not by officials ‘hare. with protecting. th public, on the-Basis:of Rar evi <dence, bat bya fiightened pubic acting on incomplete and often ‘efroncous press reports."" “The EPA had expressed concern about the safety of Alar for many years before Newsweek and ""60 Minutes"" jumped on the story. But the agency had docided that test results were ei ther flawed, contradictory or insufficiently conclusive to warrant an immediste ban and formal action was delayed, pending hear ings in late 1920, ‘David Gelber, the producer of the ""60 Minutes” Alar story and now the ecutive proce -for ABC's “Peer Jennings LIVING SCARED. Why Do the Media Make Life Seem So Risky? Second in a three-part series viewed by an estimated 40 million Americens—industry was al- ready moving away from Alar, and the nation's three major ‘baby-food makers said they were using non-Alsr apples. ‘The Natural Resources Defense Council, an activist en- vironmental group, wanted the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to ban Alar and several other pesticides. When the ‘group produced a report (""Iatolerable Risk: Pesticides in Our Children’s Food"") condemning Alar, Newsweek rushed into print withthe story before the report was officially cleased, ‘The report, Newsweek said, would “almost certainly gen- crate frightening headlines.” Indeed it did—three weeks later, right after ""60 Minutes"" aired its story. News media throughout the country—effectively ‘manipulated by-the Natural Resources Defense Council and aid~ ced by public appeals and congressional testimony from that well-known molecular biologist Meryl Streep—almost made it seem that one bite of an Alar-reated apple or one swig of juice made from Alar-treated apples would mean instant deat, ‘Coverage of the Alar scare was “outrageous ... completely alarmist,"" says Marla Cone, who writes about the environment for the Los Angeles Times. But Alar Was a made-to-order media story. It had apples, ids and cancer. “A lot of (media) people were suckered in,” Cone says. Reporting,” says EPA and scientific criticism of Alar convinced ‘him the story was worth doing atthe time. Dr. John A. Moore, then acting administrator of the EPA, said on “60 Minutes” that Alar ""should come off the market” be- ‘cause of what he had earlier described as “an inescapable and direct correlation” between exposure to Alar and “the develop- ‘ment of life-threatening tumors."" The public had a right to know that was their view,"" Gelber says. Al Meyérhoff, senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Fund, also defends the Alar story He says the apple industry launched a “concerted disinfor- ration campaign” in an effort to persuade the media and coasu- ‘mers alike that Alar was not dangerous. ‘The media have a ""tremendous problem,” Meyethoff says, {in uying to accurately and responsibly communicate risk. To be credible, they must avoid crying wolf too often. But to protect the public, they must also avoid what he calls ""crying sheep"" falling prey to timidity and self-censorship when they're criti- ized ‘There have been conflicting reports on Alar since the intial controversy.

"Vol. 21, No. 78 November 23, 1999 Reynolds Tobacco Lauds Legal Victory in Minnesota Class Action In another important legal victory for the tobacco industry, a federal court in Minnesota has denied cenification of a class-action suit secking smoking cessation and medical monitoring programs for smokers and former smokers in Minnesota. “Federal courts have unanimously rejected certification of tobacco class actions,” said Thomas P. McKim, assistant general counsc! of RJ. Reynolds Tobacco Company. “The ruling marks the 10” time that a federal court has rejected this type of case since 1997. We are very pleased that sound legal reasoning, as well as judicial common sense, have once again prevailed.” In denying certification in Janet Thompson et al. v. American Tobacco Company, Inc. et al., the USS, District Court for the District of Minnesota noted: “in the present case this analysis reveals that Piaintiffs’ Complaint is riddled with individual questions that predominate over questions ‘common to the class.” In its 26-page opinion, the Court also said: '* “Plaintiffs argue that this case can be decided without regard to the conduct or condition of Plaintiffs. In other words, Plaintiffs seek to avoid any question as to their own personal responsibility in this matter by shifting focus to the conduct of Defendants. Although establishing that Defendants’ conduct was fraudulent is necessary to the determination of this claim, the conduct and condition of each Plaintiff must also be considered. Each time the conduct or condition of Plaintiffs arises, an individualized inquiry must be undertaken. The first such instance is proof of individual injury. Its clear that in order to sustain this lawsuit Plaintiffs must have suffered some injury as a result of Defendants’ conduct.” (page 18) * “Plaintiffs contend that proof of injury can be established on a class-wide basis without engaging in individualized inquiries of each Plaintiff. Defendants argue that both addiction and increased risk of disease cannot be proven unless an individualized inquiry is undertaken. ‘The Court agrees with Defendants.” (page 19) * “Therefore, in onder to prove injury in this case, each Plaintiff must establish an addiction to cigarettes. With a class of approximately 700,000 individuals, the assessment necessary to make such @ finding would be impracticable and unmanageable and would certainly predominate over questions common to the class.” (page 21) RJRO000001531099914 70029 3778 9L9b seszs",2

Unio:tu- Hately, many clinicians are not cog nizant of the extant pleiotropy of ean cerprone genes, some of which may predispose to a bizarre spectrom of ‘cancer types within a given family and which, on occasion, may involve all three germinal layers. The age st on- fet of a specific cancer may also be extremely variable in hereditary forms of eancer, although the average age at onset will be significantly ear. lier than the sporadic counterpart. ‘Most studies of cancer in children, ineluding the Oxford Survey of Child. hhood Cancer. have focused almost ex- clusively om cancers of infancy and <hildhood. They have given only lim- ited attention to.ancerin family mem bers. When hereditary factors have ‘been considered, indepth evaluation ‘of cancer inadults hae often been given little attention. Hence, those heredi tary cancer syndromes that are char. acterized by doth childhood- and adult- onset cancers have been frequently missed. However, one noteworthy ex. ception is the recent study by Birch cet al in which the health status or ‘cause of death in the mothers of 143 children with soft-tissue sarcomas ‘were thoroughly investigated, Inter estingly, six of these mothers had the Premenopausal onset of breast cancer and two of them had bilateral disease. This represented a threefold excess risk of breast cancer. We previously described an ex- tended kindred that showed a broad ‘spectrum of cancer; namely, sarcoma, breast cancer and brain tumors, lung cancer, laryngeal carcinoma, leuke- mia, and adrenocortical earcinoma, which we referred to as the SBLA ayndrome.* This disorder had been PUBLICATIONS previously discovered in four nuclear Kindreds by Li and Fraumeni” who ‘eubsequently published a prospective ‘observation of these families that cov. ered a Wyear time frame (969 through 1961)* Of interest was the fact that in 31 surviving family members, 36 additional cancers developed (the expected number was 0.6) Five of these were carcinomas of the breast, four were soft-tissue sarcomas, and seven were cancers at other anatomic sites. Eight of the patients had multi- ple primary eancers. Four eancers oc. curred at sites of prior radiatherapy (three soft-tissue sarcomas and one mesothelioma). ‘Our purpose is to describe two sib- lings who were affected by cancer: namely,  G-yearold boy with rhab- omyosarcoma, and his sister, who died at the age of 11 year with a stioblastoma. These children repre- ‘sent a fourth generation ‘with ayn rome cancers in the original kindred with the SBLA syndrome.* REPORT OF CASES Case 1.—TWhe frat tarmor, rhabdomye- ‘arcoms, was from 2 soft-tieoe lesion sbove the right eye in a 24-yeurald bey.

"RJ Reynolds Boosts Wholesale Cigarette Prices >M0 Dy 3/7/97 6:02 PH WW YORK (AP)--The maker of Winston and Canel cigarettes boosted its wholesale prices by about 4% Friday in a move that analysts said could add about a nickel to the retail price of a pack of smokes. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., the nation's second-biggest tobacco marketer, inforned its customers late Thursday that it was boosting its prices, effective Friday, to offset rising costs. It was the first increase in cigarette prices since April 1996. Philip Morris USA, the biggest U.S. tobacco maker with brands like Marlboro and Virginia Slims, and other tobacco companies made no inmediate move to match the price hike. But analysts said they expected the industry would do so within days. Enanvel Goldman, who follows the industry for PaineWebber, said the announced increase came about a month earlier than expected, and he said Reynolds probably moved to head off hoarding by wholesalers in anticipation of a price hike. Goldnan estimated the increase in prices paid by wholesalers would result in an increase of about a nickel a pack in the retail price paid by smokers. The retail price of cigarettes varies widely because of different levels of state or local taxes. Reynolds spokeswoman Maura Ellis said her conpany's latest survey indicated the average national retail price of cigarettes was $1.74 a pack. She said Reynolds boosted its charge to wholesalers by $2 per 1,000 cigarettes, which amounts to an increase of 40 cents per carton and 4 cents a pack, But wholesalers and retailers then decide how much to add to their prices before the cigarettes reach consumers. The increase was identical to the last increase 11 months ago. Reynolds saw its share of the domestic tobacco market shrink to about 24.4% last year from 25.3% in 1995, according to the investnent firm Smith Barney. Philip Morris, Meanwhile, saw its share grow to about 48.3 from 47.14. But Goldman said he doubted that the price increase would hurt Reynolds* market share because he expected other tobacco makers would match it. ‘'There is no reason for then not to,'t he said. ‘‘Their expenses are going up and they want to increase their level of profitability."" In addition to Winston and Camel, Reynolds makes Salem and Doral cigarettes as well as other brands. In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Reynolds’ parent RIR Nabisco Holdings Corp. gained 25 cents @ share to close at $36.87 1/2 while Philip Morris was up $2.75 a RJR0000000508032297 70020 6038 bigs Leees",2

The objective of developing, ‘new transdermal nicotine system (TNS) was to pro- Vide a dosage form wit the capability of maintaining ‘constant low levels of nicotine in blood over an extend ed period after dosing. Controlling drug delivery by the ‘wansdermal route may provide an effective means of minimizing nicotine withdrawal symptoms witha great patient acceptability, ‘The objective of the pharmacokinetic studies with different TNS was to characterize the pharmacokinetics, and the bioavailability of nicotine from different TNS after single and repeated administrations to humans. ‘The pharmacokinetic investigations were a part of phat: rmacological studies assessing the local and systemic tolerability and the pharmacodynamics (6). MATERIALS AND METHODS ‘All.the study protocols had been approved by the Ethics Committee. After verbal and writen informa- ‘ign on the tet preparation and the aim and procedure (of the study, the subjects signed a declaration of con- sent which gave them the right to withdraw from the study at any time without indicating a reason. The volunteers had a complete medical check-up no longer than 12 months prior tothe study and were found to be apt to participate in human pharmacological studies.

Secondary objectives of the research were to have the target smoke several of the prototypes and relate their reactions to the cigarette. Additionally, we were interested in the target's responses to several packaging options and various promotion and on-pack insert concepts. METHODOLOGY Qualitative research was conducted in Chicago on August 28 and 29, 1989. Most participants were shown 7-9 advertising OOH comps and asked io write down and then discuss several topics regarding the advertising. ‘The topies can be summarized as follows: - To what age group would this advertising appeal the most? - Is the advertising aimed at men, women or both? - How would you describe the woman in the advertising? = Can you relate to the woman in the ads? Next, participants were asked to review and discuss six print executions and various headlines which could appear on the ads. In addition to the product testing, respondents were exposed to several packaging options, promotion and on-pack insert concepts. r i Nite aisle 1027 EAN (OI S86 PIS 88€8 6IZos",0

"lation of the entire United States, reports that only 14 per cent of regular elgarctte smokers state that they consider the habje pleasurable, safe, and worth the cost, Why do smokers not give up the habit that so many-state they would like (o shed? Despite pronouncements from health authorities in all parts of the world, the proportion of smokers reporting suceessful discontinuation of smoking is from 10 to 20 per cent in mates and 3 to 10 per cent in femates (Hacnszel et al. 1956, P. 24; Hammond & Perey 1958, p. 2,956; Cart wright et al, 1959, p. 726; and Horn 1963, p. 391). Immediately following the 1964 report of the surgeon general of the United States, 8.6 per cent of the smoking students at two U.S. colleges xe- ported that they stopped smoking as a result of the health hazard identified in this report (Katahn et al. 1964). Again, a greater percentage of male smokers (10.3 per cent) than female smokers (5.9 Per cent) reported quitting. In addition, more nat- ural science majors (18.2 per cent) quit smoking than did liberal arts majors (6.7 per cent). The same students took a story-compietion test requi ing them to create both an imaginary story and an estimate of the amount of time which in reality would have transpired during the occurrence of the sequence of events in the story. Ex-smokers tended to respond with a longer time perspective than did students who continued to smoke, and the authors suggest that these individuals might be more likely {0 worry about long-term health hazards, Immediately before and following the surgeon general's report, several researchers atiempted to find effective means for discourag-ng initiation and encouraging cessation of the smoking habit. Horn (1960) used a variety of educa:ional approaches. with high school students in Pordand, Oregon, but he reported oxty minimal success ‘i: preventing the {initiation of smoking. Both Horn (1664, personal ‘communication ) and Lawden (1965. personal com- munleation) have attempted to help adult smokers discontinue smoking through the use of weekly educational meetings (Horn fn Washington) and weekly “group therapy” sessions (Lawton in Phil- adelphia). With both techniques, success rates were not much higher than the 10 to 20 per cent “spontaneous” successes reported by other writers. The Horn and Lawton studies raise an important question for all cessation studies: who is an ex- smoker? Is he an individual who quits for a week, a month, a year, oF fotever? It fs both a common observation and an established statistical fact that SMOKING 339 many ex-smokers resume the habit after varying, 1. After reviewing, the above liter: the present withors have concluded that, in all probability, people begin t» smoke for essentially the same reasons that they adopt other habits. such as eating certain foods, using certain brands of soap. wearing lipstick, joing to sec the Beatles, and so forth, That is, initiation of smoking appesrs to be a result of the millions of dottars spent yearly by (cigarette) manufacturers to influence people 0 do 80; the standards and fads extant in youthful and adult social circles; the examples provided by parents and families; the depth of cormmitment to. personal religious codes; and, finally, some paycho- logical and personality characteristics (e.g., extra- version, tension, neuroticism, etc.) of the indi- Vidual himself, In our opinion, the last category (personality characteristics) is the least influential in determining whether a given individual will hegin to smoke, whereas the other factors Cespectally the amount spent on world-wide advertising) have con- sideri-s» influence. Once started, however, contin- ‘uation or discontinuation appears to be, in large part, a function of the sociopsychological charac. teristics of the individual. Joszpn D. MATARAzz0 AND RUTH G.

LEWIS Department of Pathology, Huntingdon Research Cenire, Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire PEV8 6ES (Accepted 1S August 1980) inrRopuction Cell renewal in the epithelium of the various levels of the respiratory tract does not occur at a uniform rate (Bertalanffy, 1968), instead it varies, even between cranial and caudal regions of the trachea (Bolduc & Reid, 1976). Several studies hhave investigated the mitotic activity in the rat trachea, bronchi, bronchioles and alveoli (Rertalanffy & LeBiond, 1953; Spencer & Shorter, 1962; Bertalanfty, 1964; Shorter, Titus & Divert, 1964: Shorter, Titus & Divertie, 1966; Blenkinsopp, 1967; Wells, 1970). However, no studies of mitotic activity of rat largyngeal epithelium hhave been traced. The larynx, in comparison with other regions of the respiratory tract, contains five distinct ‘epithelial types identifiable by electron microscopy: squamous, squamoid, respiratory and two cuboidal forms (Lewis & Prentice, 1980; Lewis, 1980), ‘The present study briefly describes the histological appearances of the various epithelial types from one micron sections and reports their mitotic indices in det MATERIALS AND METHODS Forty male, specific pathiogen-free CFHB Wistar-derived, albino rats (average weight 200) were obtained from Anglia Laboratory Animals, Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire. Immediately on arrival five rats were killed and the lungs, trachea and larynges examined histologically to assess the degree of chronic inflammatory cell infiltration, and therefore the suitability of the rats for experimentation. The remaining rats were maintained under strict barriered conditions for a 2 weeks acclimatization period, after which time four rats were given intraperitoneal injections of 0:1 mg per 190 g body weight of colchicine (Sigma Chemical Co., London) in sterile isotonic saline, The injections commenced at 10.00 am and successive animals were dosed at intervals of five minutes. Exactly 4 hours after the injection each rat was killed by an: intraperitoneal injection of sodium. pento- barbitone. In addition, one rat was given an intraperitoneal injection of isotonic saline as a vehicle control. This experiment with: four colchicine and one control rat was subsequently: repeated on six occasions. ‘The tongue, pharynx, larynx and trachea were removed. en masse and the larynx carefully dissected free, and fixed in 4% glutaraldehyde in 0-1 m cacodylate butfer, pH 73, at 4°C, for 3 hours.

Screening for lung cancer, even if targeted at high risk individuals, has so far been ineffectual, and treatment advances are modest at best. Asa result, inthe lst 20 years the 5-year lung cancer survival rate of 13% has not changed appreciably. lung cancer, are the result Factors and the biologic of an accumulation of genetic mutations caused by éavironmid process of aging, Cancer develops if the balance between the accumulation of new mutations and thi rep by enzymes feiponsbls fr DNA ilepy and Belt is disturbed, Each individual's susceptibility to cancer results from his/her inherited ability to maintain this balance. For example, some people do'ioi develop ung cancer even if they smoke more than 3 packs of cigarettes per day while others will do so even if they had ‘only minimal tobacco exposure. Identifying the genes responsible for this genetic susceptibility will be of paramount importance for future advances in lung cancer. Knowing the identity of these genes could lead to the targeting of risk factor intervention programs, early detection programs, and chemoprevention trials to those individuals at tisk for developing lung cancer rather than the population at large. Knowing the function ‘of these genes could lead to the rational design of agents (for instance drugs) which can modify or supplement genetic deficiencies. These would be major advances which could result in completely new approaches to chemoprevention and treatment. ‘Theres little doubt that most cancers, and in particular ‘During the last 3 1/2 years Dr. Gerold Bepler has successfully identified and characterized two regions on the short arm of chromosome 11 which must contain genes ‘important in lung cancer development and progression.

We had a letter from Walter Essman and have written him (see attach- ed letters), This work seems to be underway. We have set things up with Richard Levy and will start in January. There is no room for live animal air shipping until after January 7, 1974 so the schedule will start on January 18th. We must get things moving with the group at Oak Ridge. The smoking experiment is underway with the IAI and IRI cigarettes in DBA/2 and C3H/f male and female mice. They seem to tolerate 5 cigarettes in the morning and repeat in the afternoon. No deaths have occurred so we will go on up and see what it takes to kill them and then back off on the Second round. I will leave here on December 27th and return January 14th. We hope to complete a report bringing you up-to-date before I leave. This will also fulfill the contract’ request for a report before the end of @ contract period (January 31, 1974 for the smell contract). Mr. Ruwet still has no notice of continuation of this contract so we can continue to spend at the same rate. Will you, please, send along the necessary papers?

Also moving on general news wires. NEW YORK (AP) Five major U.S. cigarette makers have united to argue that the Food and Drug Administration exceeded its authority ‘with a proposal to restrict minors’ access to tobacco products, newspapers reported today. ‘The FDA's proposed rule, issued last summer, declares that, cigarettes are a drug-delivery device, and therefore subject 0 FDA jurisdiction. The proposal would require tobacco companies to fund a $150 rillion annual advertising campaign to warn children ofthe health dangers of smoking. It also would ban cigarette sales from vending machines and impose restrictions on advertising tobacco product areas deemed accessible to minors. Ina jointly submitted response, the cigarette makers said they ‘will argue the FDA's proposal would violate U.S. law and the U.S. Constitution. The industry claims the FDA does not have federal statutory authority to regulate cigarettes. The New York Times and The Wall Street Joumal both carried reports on the challenge today. In their 2,000-word response, the companies said they will also argue that nicotine does not fit the legal definition of a drug and that its effects do not fit the legal definition of addiction. The companies Philip Morris U.S.A., RJ. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Brown & Williamson, Lorillard Tobacco Co. and Liggett Group will submit their response today, the last day of the FDA rule's comment period, the newspapers said ‘An FDA spokesman dectined to comment on the tobacco companies’ response, the Journal said, Tobacco companies also filed a lawsuit against the FDA last year in an effort to block the agency's plan to regulate cigarettes. As part of the federal rule-making process, the FDA must consider the complaints and compile a record of how it responded to them before issuing a final policy. An FDA spokesman told the Times he didn't know how long that would take. AP-DS-01-02-96 0924EST Copyright (c) 1996 The Associated Press Received by NewsEDGE/LAN: 1/02/96 9:25 AM Page 3 SOLESPIDOS",9

Specifically, the revisions from the preliminary request deal with a change in ""tar"" level, a reference to flavor system stability, and inclusion of the Product Request Review and Approval Board recommendations. Additionally, this will also serve to confirm our understanding with you and other menbers of the PRRA Board on two subjects related to the development of project ¥Z: 1, The Brand will be evaluating the possibility of white tipping versus cork tipping. This is a Management request and we will be working with you and MRD to resolve this issue, hopefully, in the conceptual stages. It is our understanding that it would not be a problem for you to provide prototypes utilizing both cork and white tipping for preliminary consumer screening. It is our desire to resolve this particular matter prior to the NFO testing stage. 2, TD will begin ‘an investigation into the applicability of patent coverage on either the flavor system itself or its application to the product. We would appreciate your keeping us advised as to the status of your investigation. If we can be of assistance to you in discussing this matter with Legal, please feel free to call upon us.

Sharp, B. Kasson, D. Marshak, R. Ross, R. George, J. Sowers, and T. Yanada Research Service of the Veterans Administration Wadsworth Medical Center and the Departaents of Hedicine, Opthalmology, and Pharmacology, UCIA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, Ch. (Received in final form June 21, 1982) Summary. Donperidone, a dopamine receptor antagonist vhich apparently does Bot penetrate the blood-brain barrier in rats was administered to adult males. Dosperidone 500 pg and 100ug, given through intracarotid cannula, significantly elevated plasma prendorphtn~ inounoreactivity (-EP-I) at #15 ein. To show that only a peripheral site(s) of action is implicated, domeridone was given fo rats by canutlae implanted into both lateral venteicles. Plasma BrEP-I was unaffected by this route of adainistration. These results suggest that plasya -EP-I is tonically inhibited by dopamine acting at site(s) outside of the blood-brain barrier. Plasma rendorphin (f-EP) levels are thought to reflect secretion from.the anterior pituitary gland. Plasua B-EP usually responds to the sane agents and : influences which modulate plasma S-lipotropin (G-Ltll) and advenocortieotropia, (AcTH) (1-3), Although most studies indicate that these peptides are secreted coordinately, recentiy dexamethasone was shown to suppress plasae B-EP levels without affecting B-LPH (4). This suggests that sone pituitary cells may secrete nostly PEP into the systenic cirevlation. ‘The pituitary intermediate lobe contains high concentrations of B+EP-like Peptides derived from the same pro-opionelanocortin precursor found in the anterior lobe(S-7). In vitko experiments have shova that the iatermediate lobe responds to a different set of agents than those effecting secretion from the anterior lobe and dopanine has been shown to suppress intermediate lobe secretion of PEP-Like peptides(8,9). Recently, dopaminergic regulation of canine and rat plasma B-EP-I has been observed (10-12). This is inhibited by pre-infusion with Gopanine or other dopamine receptor antagonists. We sought to extend these observations to the rat and to evaluate whether a dopamine receptor antagonist activates secretion of B-EP-I only at a site(s) outside of the bloodsbrain Partier. Domperidone, a dopamine receptor antagonist which may not cross the Dlood-brain barrier vhen aduinistered peripherslly, was chosea to investigate these issues (13). 0024~3205/82/100981-05603.00/0 Copyright (c) 1982 Perganon Press Ltd. 50238023",6

"INTEROFFICE MEMORANDUM AUGUST 31, 1993 TO: HRRC FROM: FRED BEST SUBJECT: CAMEL Light casing ingredient optimization screening study. Request for approval to use higher than normal burley casing levels for sensory evaluation. A. Background - The Flavor Division would like to know the optimum levels of HFCS (high fructose corn syrup), cocoa and licorice to use in burley casing to obtain reduced harshness and more smoothness while maintaining or enhancing tobacco taste. In other words provide a more acceptable cigarette to the franchise. Doubts have been raised recently as to the need for licorice and cocoa in casing. Also, although HFCS is being tested on many products because it provides economic advantages, optimum use levels have not been determined. This current proposal is a screening study with 4 parts (high, medium and low levels of all 3 ingredients and a CAMEL Light control) to determine if sensory panels can distinguish between different casing levels. If they can, a large casing optimization study will be conducted. B. Human Participants - are needed because smoker preference is the only valid method of evaluation. €. Scientific Affairs Review - All 3 ingredients are commonly used in current casings at lower levels. Scientific Affairs xequested that we get Ames testing on the product with the highest levels of casing ingredients. This was done and no difference was found between the test product with high casing levels and a CAMEL Light control (see Attachment 1 for AMES report). Scientific Affairs has cleared these products for sensory testing pending HRRC approval. A copy of the Scientific Affairs recommendation is attached (see attachment 2). D. Product Description - Three test products made in CAMEL Light configuration and a CAMEL Light control will be used. Since endogenous sugar levels in flue-cured and Turkish tobaccos vary significantly and make sugar additions to final blend difficult to measure, this study is designed to evaluate levels applied to the burley prior to final blending. sugar additions to final blend were calculated. Since there is no endogenous cocoa or licorice in tobacco, measured levels on final blend were considered addition’ levels.

Richardson,’ and Nava Segev** Departnents af “Pharmacological and Physiological Sciences, Molecular Geneties and Cel Biology und Biochemistry and Molecalar Biology, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Ilinois 60637 Abstract. Small GTPases of the rab family are involved in the regulation of vesicular transport. Itis believed that cycling between the GTP- and GDP-bound forms, ‘and accessory factors regulating thi cycling are crucial for rab function, However, an essential rote for rab mu- cleotide exchange factors has not yet been demon- strated, In this report we show the requirement of nu- cleotide exchange factor activity for Yptl GTPase ‘mediated protein transport. The Yptl protein, a mem- ber ofthe rab family, plays a role in targeting vesicles to the acceptor compartment and i essential for the first two steps ofthe yeast secretory pathway. We use two YPTT dominant mutations that contain alterations in & highly conserved GTP-binding domain, N/2/F and DI2AN. YPTL-DI24N isa novel mutation that encodes a protein with nucleotide specificity modified from gun- nine to xanthine. This provides a tool for the study of an individual rab GTPase in crude extracts: a xan- thosine triphosphate (XTP)-dependent conditional dominant mutation, Both mutations confer growth in- hibition and a block in protein secretion when cx- pressed in vivo, The purified mutant proteins do not bind either GDP or GTP. Moreover, they completely inhibit the ability of the exchange factor to sti nucleotide exchange for wild type Yptt prote potent inhibitors of ER to Golgi transport in the vesicle targeting step. The inhibitory effects of the ‘Yptl-D124N mutant protein on both nucleotide ex- change activity and protein transport in vitro can be re- lieved by XTP, indicating that it isthe nucleotide-free form of the mutant protein that is inhibitory. These re~ sults suggest that the dominant mutant proteins inhibit protein transport by sequestering the exchange factor from the wild type Ypt] protein, and that this factor has an essential role in vesicular transport. ‘way involves their orderly progression through ase~ ries of membranous compartments (Palade, 1975). ‘Transport between successive secretory compartments ap- pears to be mediated by vesicles (Jamieson and Palade, 41067; Pfeffer and Rothman, 1987; Rothman, 1994). How. fever, the mechanisms that regulate the directionality and specificity ofthese vesicular transport steps are not known, ‘The rab/¥ptl/See4 family of small GTPases has been shown to play a role in vesicular trafficking (Ferro-Novick nd Novick, 1993; Zerial and Stenmark, 1993). t hus been suagested that these proteins act at the different steps of the secretory pathway to ensure the fidelity of vesicular targeting (Bourne, 1988; Segev et al., 1988; Lian et al., 1984; Spgarrd et al, 1994).

Most GTP-bind- ing proteins have slow intrinsic rates of guanine nucleotide eachange, and thus requite accessory factors to stimulate the exchange reaction “The importance of nucleotide exchange for function of rab-G TPases has been implied in several studies.

CRITIQUE Justice, Science, and the “Bad Guys” When accused of a new offense, does someone regarded asa “bad guy"" have the right to due process and a fair trial? If such a right is inberent in the legal systems of civilized society, isitalso a pant of justice in the “courts” of scientific evaluation? I ask these questions because, in private conversation, I re- cently heard an authoritative leader in the world of public health epidemiology make the following statement: “Yes, it's rotten science, but it's in a ‘worthy cause. It will help us get rid of cigarettes and become a smoke-free society.” ‘The statement, of course, referred to the data and ‘evaluations assembled in the past few years for ac- cusations about what is formally called environ- ‘mental tobacco smoke and informally designated as passive smoking. According to the accusations, this, type of exposure causes at least 2 of the prime evils hitherto attributed to direct smoking: lung cancer and cardiovascular disease. In fact, several of the recent cardiovascular studies found risks that were even higher for passive smokers than for direct smokers. (The authors tactfully refrained, however, from stating the implicit conclusion that people who cannot avoid passive exposure should lower their risk by beginning to smoke directly.) A new part of the current indictment is the claim ‘that passive smoking is responsible for respiratory and otologic difficulties in children. Because young children so rarely engage in direct smoking, pedia- tricians have hitherto had little participation in the research industry devoted to studying cigarettes. Now, with open hunting season declared on the ef- fects of passive smoking in children, a fertile new opportunity has arisen for selfless public service, fame, grants, and publications. ‘Nevertheless, if the science is as “rotten” as the public health authority admitted, does the end really Justify the means? If objectivity, precautions against bias, and careful operating guidelines are essential for a “bad guy” to get fair treatment in a court of law, should those principles be abandoned or abol- ished when the “bed guy” is in a court of science? A peripheral inspection, without any in-depth ap- praisals, of the current accusations about passive smoking would suggest that many scientific prin- ciples have vanished. I shall cite 3 overt examples: 1) Many of the pediatric researchers seem un- ‘aware of the frequent disparity between symptoms and objective evidence ofailmeats whenever people are passively exposed to a “bad guy.” Perhaps the mont striking demonstration of this phenomenon STIGST SFOS",6

"Phorbol ester and okadaic acid regulation of Na-2Cl-K cotransport in rabbit tracheal epithelial cells CAROLE M. LIEDTKE AND LINDA THOMAS Cystic Fibrosis Center, Department of Pediatrics at Rainbow Babies and Children Hospital, and Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio 44106 Liedtke, Carole M., and Linda Thomas. Phorbol ester ‘and okadaic acid regulation of Na-2CI-K cotransport in rabbit tracheal epithelial cells.Am. J. Physiol. 271 (Cell Physiol. 40): ‘C838-C346, 1996.—We evaluated a role for protein kinase C (PKC) in the regulation of rabbit tracheal epithelial Na-Cl(K) cotransport, Short-term treatment with phorbol 12-myristate S-avetate (PMA) dose dependently increased bumetanide- sensitive Na and Cl efflux and elevated staurosporine- and >bumetanide-sensitive Na, Cl, and K uptake. PMA and the ayvadrenergic agonist guanabenz both induced cotransport with a stoichiometry of 2 Cl:1 Na and 2 Cl:1 Rb and elevated staurosporine-sensitive PKC activity in cytosolic and particu- late fractions. Prolonged PMA treatment did not sustain bumetanide-sensitive 2 Cl:1 Na and 2 Cl:1 Rb transport but did block stimulation of bumotanide-sensitive transport by PMAor guanabent and elevation of PKC activity by PMA and guanabenz in a particulate fraction. Cells treated with oka- daic acid exhibited a staurosporine- and bumetanide-sensi- tive 2 Cl:1 Na and 2 CL: Rb uptake. In cultured monolayers, basolateral perfusion with epinephrine, isoproterenol, or PMAincroasod ehort-cirouit eurrent ([y)-Basolateral applica- tion of bumetanide reduced elevated J. to baseline levels, indicating a role for Cl secretory cells in a reconstituted tracheal epithelium, Pretreatment of transmonolayer cul ‘tures with PMA diminished the stimulatory response to epinephrine. These results indicate that, in rabbit tracheal epithelial cells, a-adrenergic stimulation activated Na-2C1-K at PKG is a critical effector in this process. ‘a-adrenergic receptors; loop diuretics; bumetanide; protein phosphatase; guanabenz; epinephrine; clonidine; transmono- layer cultures; staurosporine; protein kinase C ‘ONE MODE OF TRANSPORTING the electrolytes Na and Cl ‘that is common to many cell types is cotransport of the electrolytes Na and Cl, which is directly coupled to the inwardly directed Na electrochemical gradient as the driving force for Cl uptake. An additional requirement for K is seen in some cells under specific stimulatory conditions, such as, for example, vasopressin stimula tion of mouse medullary thick ascending limb (82). We have previously shown that Na-Cl cotransport in hu- man and rabbit tracheal epithelial cells is activated by a-adrenergic agonists (15) and hyperosmotic challenge (16). The Ca ionophore ionomycin mimics the response too-adrenergie stimulation. Other studies show second- ary activation of cotransport in canine tracheal epithe- lial cells, which is mediated by agents that stimulate cal Cl channels to induce Cl secretion (10, 11). These studies correlated stimulation of salt secretion by isopro- terenol, ATP, and UTP to the equilibrium level of saturable, basolateral bumetanide-binding sites. The caa8 finding of increased bumetanide binding with induction of Cl secretion was interpreted as upregulation of cotransport in Cl secretory cells. Our finding of direct activation of cotransport by a adenosine 3',5'-eyclic monophosphate (cAMP)-indepen- dent mechanism led to detailed studies of the intracel- lular signaling of the a-adrenergic stimulation. The studies first focused on effectors involved in Ca-dependent mecha- nisms for signal transduction. The results demonstrate a-adrenergic activation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5- bisphosphate (Ptdins(4,5)Pz}-specific phospholipase C with subsequent hydrolysis of Ptdine(4,5)P, to two intracellular second messengers, inositol phosphate (17) and diacylglycerol (18). The transient nature of mediator release within a time frame that coincides with cotransporter activation suggested a link between Ca and diacylglycerol. These two intracellular media- tors are activators for some isotypes of protein kinase C (PKC; Ref. 31). PKC subsumes a family of at least 10 subtypes, some of which require Ca for activation (26, 31), PKC has been linked to the regulation of other electrolyte trans- porters, including cation and anion exchangers that operate during cell volume regulation, salt absorption, and pH regulation and ion channels that are required for secretion, in particular an apical Cl channel (2, 4,6). ‘A useful tool in identifying and characterizing PKC regulation is phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), phorbol ester that activates PKC (31). The effects PMA often show a time dependence that is interpreted as resulting from activation (early) or downregulation Cate) of PKC. For example, with some ion exchangers, such as Na/H or CVHCO, (of thyroid and Vero cells, respectively), short-term treatment with PMA acti- vates ion exchange, whereas long-term treatment with PMA, which chronically activates PKC, fails to alter electrolyte transport through ion exchangers (22, 34). In the latter instance, chronic activation of PKC leads ‘to downregulation due to increased sensitivity to prote- lysis (81). Short-term PMA treatment can induce opposing responses, as seen in intestinal and renal epithelial cells (35). In these cells, Ne/H exchangers found on apical membranes are inhibited by PMA, which produces an opposite effect of stimulation on cation exchangers in the basolateral surface. PMA also influences the activity of Na-Cl-K eotrans- porters in epithelial and nonepithelial cells. Fibro- blasts (27, 30), endothelial cells (26), and osteoblasts (88) express a cotransporter that is sensitive to PMA, ‘thus suggesting regulation through PKC.

"“American Cancer Society Seeks a Reopening of Hearings on Tobacco” New York Times (06/14/95) P. A16; Collins, Glenn ‘The American Cancer Society called upon Congress on Tuesday to reopen hearings on the nation's tobacco manufactures, saying that the tobacco industry had ""surreptitiously"" obtained its 1979 working papers about tobacco's cancer-causing effects. The allegation came in response to the disclosure last week of the existence of documents revealing that Philip Morris Inc. had conducted 15 years of research on nicotine's effects on the physical and behavioral aspects of smokers. Papers from the cancer society were amiong the documents. Dr. LaMar McGinnis, the society's president, said Tuesday that the society assumed that the tobscco industry's intention was to use the society's data “to help plan their own counter-strategy of dismissing the huge health consequences of tobacco use, and further increase their sales.” Philip Morris attomey Charles R. Wall said the cancer society offered no proof that the papers weren't obtained through legitimate measures. Cancer society spokesman Thomas Brandt countered that a working document on a policy issue would not have been made available to the public until a decision had been made on it, The eancer society said the documents included its draft policy statement on low tar and nicotine cigarettes, dated October 19, 1979, and prepared for a meeting the following month. Brandt said that statement was obtained by the Tobacco Institute several weeks prior to that meeting and \was sent to various tobacco company execuitives.

"Beitrige tur Tabaforschung International Design Criteria for Ventilated Filters* by James A. Parker and Robert T. Montgomery Celanese Fibers Company, Charlotte, North Carolina, US. INTRODUCTION ‘There is great interest in the effecs of ventilation on the chemisey of cigarette smoke. Filter ventilation, using ‘porous plig wrap and perforated tipping paper, decreases ‘condensate delivery and ths i important in view of the rowing consumer preference for “low rar"" brands (less than 15 milligrams) Low condensate cigaretes increased 10 34.58% of US. sales in 1978, up by 9.6% (relative) from 1977 (1). Although several researchers have studied smoke filtration in ven slated cigaretes (2, 3 4, i was the purpose of this work to.extend these investigations to include a broad range of filter tow items and alzo several commercially used, ven- tilaced filters. The data showed that ventilation gives a basic design capability for controlling 2 number of smoke parameters MATERIALS AND METHODS ‘Two studies were performed to measure the effects of air ventilation: one based upon testing filters made from cellule acetate tows of increasing denier per filament (dpf),and a second using commercial sir-ventlated filters. Tn the first study, sx tow items were prepared in conven tional filter construction, where the degree of ventilation was varied by size and location of tipping paper perfor ations. The second study involved smoking a number of ‘commercial filers all of which incorporated some physical method for air dilation. Figure 1 shows the construction of the reference cigarette used in the first study. A series of these cigarettes was prepared on commercial equipment using a 64 mm stan- ard tobacco column, Two levels of ventilation were achieved using MalaucineM 1.5 and M3.0 laserperforated filer tip papers, where the coal atea of the holes in the M3. paper was approximately ewice the open area of the M-1.5 paper. In addition, control filters wsing non- ‘ventilated tipping were made. For each of the thre tip- ping configurations, six tow items were tested for which the pf canged from less than 1.5 to 5.0 and the total denier varied from 40,009 to $0,000. Filter size, 25.0 mm circumference and 21 mm length, was held constant. The plug wrap was Schweitzer No. 912, having a Coresta Volume 10 No. 1 December 1979 €EPL80r0sz permeability of 26,000 cm per min. Ten percent (w/w) triacetin was used asa plasticizer In the second investigation, thirteen commercial filers ‘were hand-tipped to 2 64 mm standard tobacco column. For both studies, presure drop, percent ai dilution, puff ‘count, particulate delivery, gas phate delivery of selected ‘components, and filtration efficiency were measured. Particulate matter delivery was measured by the Federal ‘Trade Commission method (5). Particulate removal ef- Ficiencies were derived according to Keith and Newsome (6). CO was measured by gas chromatography (7), and aldehydes were determined colorimetrically (8). The per- cent dilution was the unit puff dilution volume, measured by a bubble burette connected through encapsulation to the ventilating perforations [cf. (4)]. The puff-by-puff ventilation and tip pressure drop were assumed constant throughout smoking of a cigarete (4).

"A=10 (No. 87) Despite his preference for bilateral negotiations, Yeutter said that the Japanese would have to give in on beef and citrus if both countries were to return to the table. “Tt takes two to tango, and the Japanese negotiators were not tangoing,” 1e said. “I was getting tired of negotiating with myself.” Japanese Offer ‘The trade representative explained that Sato had offered to remove Javanese quotas on beef over three years, increasing the quota levels—to let in more goods—by 10 perceni annually, and then eliminating them entirely in the fifth year. For citrus, the Japa- nese had offered to remove quotas after five years. ‘Yeutter explained tat the United States would have been willing to accep: the three-year removal of beef quotas, but that the Japanese had also wanted to impose a type of import surcharge on US. beef in exchange for the tariff removal. Yeutter said he could not accept this offer, because although the quotas would be removed, the price constraints “could be just as onerous” as what was originally in place, he said, With regard to citras, Yeutter said that he was not willing to accept a f've-year tariff removal without compensation for the U.S. citrus industry. “What we had offered was two years, with anything over that including a patience payment,” which, he explained is a compensatory payinent agreed to prior to a GATT. ruling. “We felt that live years was far too long,” he added. At the press confcrence, Agriculture Department officials circulated a statement from Agriculture Sec- retary Richard Lyng, who is currently in Fallbrook, Calif. In the statement, Lyng said that he was “extemely disappoint>d” that. an agreement had not. been reached, and tiat he had supported Yeutter's| efforts toward a resolution.) : Advertising HEALTH OFFICIALS URGE CONGRESS TO RESTRICT CIGARETTE ADVERTISING; CHARGE DECEPTION Representatives. of “public health groups. May 4 urged a House subconnittee to push ahead with pro- posed legislation (HR 1532, HR 3294) to restrict or ban cigarette advertising, charging that ads for low-tar and low-nicotine produets are deceptive. . ‘Tobacco companies ‘are consciously deceiving the public by using their advertising to lull smokers into believing that so-calle4 “light” cigarettes— those con- taining lower levels of tar and nicotine—are safe.to smoke although there is no medical evidence that light cigarettes pose less uf a health hazard, the public health officials charged. . “Consumers who pii:chase low-tar and low-nicotine cigarettes believing that they are substantially redue- ing their risk of heart disease, chronic obstructive lung disease or cance are seriously mistaken,” said Dr. Alfred Munzer..oi the Coalition on Smoking or Health—composed of the American Heart Associ- REGULATION, ECONOMICS AND LAW (DER) 5-5-88 ation, American Lung Association, and American Can- cer Society—told the House Energy and Commerce Transportation, ‘Tourism, and Hazardous Materials Subcommittee. “Advertisements which promote these cigarettes, directly or indirectly, as significantly safer alternatives, are patently false.” ° Dr. Robert E. Medfee, of the American Medical Association, noted that while tobacco companies are touting the health benefits of light cigarettes in their advertising, medical studies show many smokers of light cigareites end up getting about the same doses of tar and nicotine as smokers of regular cigarettes because they tend to inhale more deeply and smoke more cigarettes. “There is no safe cigarette and no safe level of tobacco consumption,” he said McAfee charged that advertisements for light ciga- rettes are confusing, if not outright deceptive. For ‘example, he said, cigarette makers use such labelling terms as “low tar,” “lower tar,” “ultra low tar,"" “lights”, and “ultra’ lights” which are industry desig- nations with no legal or medical meaning. Such terms are “misleading and are applied to many brands ‘which do not provide lower doses of tar and nicotine,” he said. Scott D. Ballin, vice president for public affairs for the Coalition on Smoking or Health, charged that the Federal Trade Commission has failed: to take action against deceptive low tar and nicotine advertise- ments. Ballin said that the coalition supports HR 3294, which’ would require “that cigarette ‘advertising be regulated under Food and Drug Administration mat Keting guidelines for legal drugs."" - me FTC Testimony Consumers are better served:by an unregulated advertising environment, since they are likely to bs exposed to more information that way, FC Chairman Daniel Oliver argued. As long as the information on tar and nicotine content is accurate, advertisements promoting light cigarettes “can be a’ valuable source of information to consumers,” he said. If the advertis- ing is deceptive, the FTC will take action against the company, he added."" we Subcommittee chairman Rep. Thomas Luken (D- Ohio) and ranking minority. member Bob Whittaker (R-Kan)—who previously introduced HR 3294 and HR* 1582, which would impose a total ban on cigarette advertising—said that they are working on another bill which would allow states to'require more strin- gent health warnings than federal law ‘requires. Tt ‘would also. permit plaintiffs: to bring” suit against cigarette companies even if the companies complied with federal warnings and it would require the FTC to contract with either a government or private labora- tory to conduct annual studies of tar and nicotine levels, The laboratory would also collect data on the average levels of other: chemicals commonly found in cigarettes, including carbon monoxide, ammonia, cya- nide, formaldehyde, and radioactive compounds. The representatives expect to introduce the bill, which is still being drafted, this week.C] CCopyiight © 1988 by THE BUREAU OF NATIONAL AFFAIRS, INC., Washington, 0.6. 20087 or4e-3155/89/800.50 TIMN 0061655",9

These protocols are contained in the attached copy of the Protocol Subcommittee Report in the form of a letter dated October 2, 1969, with attachments, from Dr. Eldon Nielson, Chairman of the Subcommittee. ‘ It has been agreed for the manufacture of the cigarets that the P. Lorillard ! Company would prepare the strips of tobacco, blended in the proper proportions 4 to match the Kentucky Reference Cigaret formula, and ship them to R. J.

Accordingly, Dr. Murray Senkus, of Reynolds, will name the person , who will act as the industry technical representative in your negotiations with American Chemosol Corporation for the purpose of specifying the conditions of treatment and securing. the certification of the sample, as mentioned in my letter addressed to Mr. Thomas Austern, dated September 26, 1969. Please be reminded of our recommendation that the industry side insist that the American Chemosol Corporation not give any publicity to the submission of these two protocols to them for their examination or to reveal in any way the details of the test program to the public press.

Through his wisdom, insight, ereativity, oF ganizational genius and inexhaustible energy, he has Played a major role in the initiation and development of many agpeets of environmental health science through- fut the international scientific eommunity. The nature, scope, and direction of virtually every major component of current environmental health science research have been influenced directly or indireetly by Dr. Nelson's ae- tivities It is therefore entirely appropriate that this sym posium has been organized in his honor, and it is a per- Sonal pleasure for me to have this opportunity to express ‘my admiration, respect, and appreciation for his many contributions. “Department of Apled Bicol Slonces, Massachusetts Insite ot Technology, Cambridge, MA 0259. aa cal eneral reiective of elevated levels of exposure In certain respects, the current status of the field of markers of earcinagen exposure represents a culmination of efforts to bring together current knowledge about mechanisms of eareinogenesis and mutagenesis and Tighly sophisticated analytical methods to detect molecu- Jur and cellular events that may be predictive of health risks. This isa very timely and important area of research endeavor, inasmuch as the process of risk assessment is finding increasing application by regulatory decision- rmuking bodies in the process of formulating policies in- tended to minimize health risks resulting from exposure to hazardous substances, The process of tisk assessment requires the use of factual data to define the health effects of exposure of individuals or of populations to such sub: stances. By current definitioa, the process of risk assess- ment includes three elements: hazard identification, dose- Tesponse assessment, and risk characterization. Ex posure assessment and epidemiology data are key com- ponents of the dose-response assessment, the objective br wvhich is to define dose-ineidence relationships for ad- verse health effects (such as cancer) in human popular tions.

Concern over the average never smoker's lung cancer risk from exposure to “environ- ‘mental"" tobacco smoke (ETS)has grown considerably since a 1981 study reported an association between ung cancer in nonsmokers and marriage to a smoker Hirayama, 1981). Since then, other epidemiological studies of the association between lung cancer among nonsmokers and ETS exposure from living with ‘smoker have been conducted in Japan (Akiba ¢1 al., 1986), Greece (Trichopoulos et al., 1963), Hong Kong (Chan & Fung, 1982; Koo et al., 1985), Sweden (Per- ‘shagen et al., 1987), Great Britain (Gillis et al., 1984; Lee et al., 1986), and the U.S. (Garfinkel et al., 1981; Correa et al., 1983; Bufflere7 al., 1984; Kabat & Wyn- der, 1984; Garfinkel e7 al., 1985; Dalager e1 al., 1986; Brownson ef al., 1987; and Humble et al., 1987). The “To whom sl correspondence should be addressed results of these studies have been used to estimate an average excess lung cancer risk for never smokers of 30% from ETS exposure (Blot & Fraumeni, 1986; NRC, 1986; Wald et al., 1986; Wigle et al., 1987). Al- termatively, the risk can be estimated by downward ‘extrapolation techniques based on the lung cancer risk for current smokers and the average exposure of cur- rent and never smokers. The former method is a risk- ‘based estimate whereas the latter is an exposure-based estimate. Linear Extrapolation This study uses linear downward extrapolation to ‘estimate the lung cancer risk and the number of U.S. Jung cancer deaths for male and female never smokers in 1980 from exposure to ETS. The final estimate of the number of ETS-attributable never smoker lung ‘cancer deaths requires four preliminary estimates: 1. The number of never smokers at risk, 2. The average tobacco smoke exposure of never smokers, 87597636",6

The intent of ths effort is to minimize the amount of lab chemicals that are sent to the stock room for commercial disposal. Commercial disposal is expensive and should be utilize only when there is not a more cost effective option available. Disposal options must be safe and comply with environmental regulations. Reduction can be achieved if lab personne! are better informed on the disposal options that are available for managing waste chemicals. T have attached a document (LAB CHEMICAL WASTE DISPOSAL GUIDELINES) for your review. The group needs to determine if these guidelines are workable and make changes as necessary.

We believe that Lorillard has met the actual requirements ofthe trademark license and gone beyond, in order to try to assuage Harley's concerns, Nevertheless, we believe that regardless of the specific requirements of the contract, we are desirous of having a relationship where Harley is satisfied. We would therefore welcome any suggestions you might have for what further might be done to satisfy Harley. ‘We believe that the Loews Corporation annual report and the Loews Corporation 10K provide sufficient separate information regarding Lorillard to satisfy the requirements of Section 17. In addition we have provided access to your accountants to Lorillard's books for your further assurance and we have provided a Lorillard, Inc. guarantee of Lorillard Tobacco Company's ‘obligations to obviate any concems you may have arising out of the Lorillard, Inc/Tobacco reorganization By law, the Loews Corporation annual report and/or the 10K, among other SEC reporting, would require the reporting of any materially adverse change in the financial condition of Lorillard. Furthermore, Lorillard's accounting firm, Deloitte Touche would not certify these reports as it has, ifthe separate Lorillard subsidiary had suffered a materially adverse change. Consequently, we believe that Section 17 has been satisfied. We do not understand your comments in the second paragraph. ""Assets equal to equity” ‘means the absence of liabilities which does not apply to Lorillar's situation. Lorillard's consistent practice over the years has been to declare or defer dividends depending upon the balance sheet. ‘Any act which caused a material adverse change would thereby cause Harley Davidson to be notified, ‘Since Lorillard first entered into this license with Harley Davidson, the tobacco companies gece9zh6",0

"CALIFORNIA LEGISLATORS WANT TO RAISE YOUR TAXES AGAIN !!! The California State Legislature is currently considering proposals to increase the state excise tax on cigarettes. One of these proposals, AB55, goes so far as to give local Boards of Supervisors, throughout the state, the power to impose unlimited tax increases on cigarettes. Under this proposal, local elected officials could actually double the price consumers pay for cigarettes. This proposal gives local government the power to solve local financial problems by raising cigarette taxes.

DEAN BEFUS, AND JOSEP 8. Dav: 180. Hemodynamic changes associated with anaphylaxis in parasite-sensitized rats. Am J. Physiol, 258 (Heatt Cire. Phys: fol. 27): H1126-HLLSL, 1990,—Thirty days after infection with the parasite Nipposérongyius brasiliensis, microcirculatory changes associaced with worm allergen-induced anaphylactic shock in pentobarbital-anesthetized rats were studied. Allergen ‘challenge decreased heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, ‘and cardiac output (CO) for 60 min, although CO increased markedly by 240 min. Blood flow (ml-min""™-g wet tissue"") duced to most tissues, with the exception of the kidneys, hepatic arterial, heart, and brain, for 60 mir. Depressed flow to the adrenals and enhanced flow to the kidneys, trachea, stomach, and mesentery were observed at 40 min. The percent distribution of eardiac output per gram wet tissue (%CO/g) inezeased initially to the kidneys, heart, liver, and cervical spinal cord, decteased to the spleen and cocura, and remained unchanged to other gastrointestinal tissues. ‘The %CO/g to ‘most tissues returned to normal by 60 min but decreased to the adrenals at 240 min, ‘The intestine is an important organ affected by anaphylaxis inthe rat, and the liver may participate in alleviating anaphylaxis. circulatory shock; microspheres; microcirculation; Nippostron- ‘gylus brasiliensis ANAPHYLAXIS is an immediate type of allergic reaction that ean induce either a local response in a sensitive tissue or organ or a systemic anaphylaxis, which precip- itates circulatory collapse and life-threatening shock. A ‘common feature of anaphylaxis among different species is respiratory distress and asphyxia (9), although species- specific dysfunctions of other organs have been noted Early studies of Sanyal and West (25) identified the intestine as the primary organ affected by anaphylaxis in the rat as marked hemorrhaging was observed. Species differences in the organs affected by anaphylaxis occur with right heart failure taking place in the rabbit (1), and hepatic congestion occurring in the dog (1, 15) Rats that have been infected with the nematode Nip- postronaylus brasiliensis exhibit elevated concentrations Of parasite-specific immunoglobulin antibodies (5). The intestine is the main organ affected by anaphylaxis in the sensitized rat when the rat is exposed to a single infection of N. brasiliensis (16, 17, 20). Repeated expo- ssure to the parasite, however, results in a transition from intestine to lung as the primary organ affected by ana- phylaxis organ (16, 17). When the rat is exposed to a single infection, mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils #1126 are recruited to the intestinal mucosa (12), although immune and inflammatory responses occur elsewhere, €.. the trachea, spleen, and the lungs (2). Although the integrity of the intestine may be primarily affected dur- ing anaphylaxis, other as yet unidentified tissues may participate in and contribute to development of the shock syndrome. In an attempt. to more precisely define tissues that participate in a systemic anaphylactic response in the rat, we determined blood flow to a variety of tissues and. organs in animals that had previously heen sensitized to N- brasiliensis, We used radiolabeled microspheres to ‘measure regional blood flow changes, a technique that has been applied successfully to the monkey (26) and the dog (15, 29) to study changes in the cardiovascular sys- tem associated with anaphylaxis MATERIALS AND METHODS Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Canada) of an initial weight of 200-250 ¢ were maintained in filter-top cages (2-3 per cage) to minimize the possibility of other infections Animals were infected subcutaneously in the scruff of the neck with 3,000 third stage infective larvae of Nip- postrongylus brasiliensis. The larvae were collected from fecal cultures (2) and extensively washed before injec- tion. Thirty to 35 days after the initial sensitization, the anaphylactic reaction was initiated by an intravenous jection (via the penile vein with a 27-gauge needle) with 100 l of antigen containing 150 worm equivalents of homogenized N. brasiliensis, Previous studies have established that most of the worms are expelled from the animal by 2 wk after infec- tion (30). To control for the effects of a residual parasitic infection on regional blood flows, a group of infected rats (n= 5) was treated with the anthelmintic agent thiaben- dazole (Thibenzole, Merck, Sharp & Dohme) given at 80 mg/kg in aqueous suspension by stomach tube (13) Seven days after treatment with the deworming agent, blood flows and percent distribution of cardiac output (CO) were examined at 5 min after antigen challenge. Hemodynamics were studied 10 min before injecting antigen and at three time points (5, 60, and 240 min) after intravenous injection of antigen. Separate groups of rats were used for the three time points studied, Anesthesia was induced before surgery with intraperito- neal pentobarbital sodium (30 mg/kg body wt) and main- 0983.6185/80 $150 Copyright © 1990 the American Physiological Societe 50641690",6

Transfection of truncation mutants of the human IL-4 (hull-4) receptor Into320-IRS-1 cells demonstrated thatthe region from ‘amino acid 437-587 is important for IL-4 signaling. This region of the IL-4 receptor (IL-4R) contains the ‘motif “""PL-X4-NPXYXSXSO* (Insulin/IL-4R {14RD {ound in the insulin and insulinike growth factor 1 receptors, Mutation of Y497 to yielded receptors that ‘caused lttle or no IRS-1 phosphorylation in response tohull-4 when expressed in 32D-IRS-t colle. Most cll lines expressing Y497F also foiled to proliferate in response to hull-4, Furthermore, a glutathione-S- transferase fusion proteln containing the 14A motit~ ‘bound IRS-1, tyrosinekinase(s), and other unidentified phosphoproteins with molecular sizes of 140, 80, and '55 kd. Thus, the central tyrosine of the I4R motif has ‘4 major role in IL-4-mediated signal transduction In 320 col Introduction Inteteukin- (IL-4) is a cytokine produced by T cells How- ard ot al, 1982), mast calls (laut eta, 1989), and baso- phils (Seder eta, 1991). Among Its diverse array of bic loge functions (reviewed by Paul, 1991) are the abilty to Induce or enhance the expression of major histocompat bilty complex class II molecules (Noolle et al, 1984) and (6023 00 B cals (Conad et al, 1987), its own receptor ‘onlymphocytes (Ohara and Pavi, 1988), and vascular call ‘adhesion molecule 1 on endothalilcolis(Schieimer et al 11992); the ability to induce the secretion ofimmunoglobu- lint (vtotaetat., 1988) andimmunoglobuln (Coffman ‘tal, 1986) while diminishing the immunoglobulin secre- tion of other isotypes: and the ability to act as a growth factor for B calls, T cells, and mast cals (Lee ota, 1986). 40007130 ‘This diverse array of IL-¢-mediated effocts i roflectd in the broad cistibution of IL-4 recoptrs (IL-4Rs). A single lass of high-atfnty binding sites (K., 20-300 pM) have ‘been detected on a wide varity of hematopoietic andinon- ‘hematopoietic cal types at levels ranging trom 100-5000 sites/cell Ohara and Pau, 1887; Park tal, 1987; Lowen thal tal, 1988). The molecular cloning of CDNA encoding ‘both the murine IL-4R (mulL-4R) (Mosley etal, 1989; H ada etal, 1980) and human IL-4R (null-4R) (lazerda et ‘al, 1990; Gazz etal, 1990) andthe expression in COST ‘ols indicated that a single chain of ~ 139,000 daltons constituted ahigh-affinityIL-4-binding sito, Recently, thas ‘been shown thatthe IL-2R y chain (common ye) i 4880 ciated with IL-4F in the presence of IL-4 (Russel etal, 1993) and that its presence contributes a 2- to 3d in crease in binding afinty. The IL-4F contains the charac- teristic pairs of cysteine residues and the WSXWS moti found in other members of the hematopoiatin receptor su- perfamily, anit beare one ofthe largest cytoplasmic do- ‘mains, comprised of over 500 amino acids (Cosman, 1983) Like otner members ofthis receptor family, the IL-4F. ‘doesnot contain any consensus sequences characterise of tyosine or serinethreonine kinases. However, actva- tion ofthe IL-4R with IL induces the rapid and striking tyrosine phosphorylation ofa 170 kd protein (Mora et al. 1988; sfortand no, 1990; Wang eta, 1992), called 4PS, ‘a well as phosphorylation of the recoptor itso (Wang et al, 1992; luhnaraandHarada, 1993),suggestingalinkage ‘among the IL-4R, 4PS, anda yrosine kinase. Phosphory- lation of 4S results in its association withthe p85 subunit ‘ofphosphotidylinsite:3kinase P1-3K) andthe subsequent induction of PIK activity (Wang et a, 1992). Interest- ingly. it was found that 4°S is antigenically related to a prominent substrate of tho insulin receptor Kinase, called Inauinocoptor substrate 1(IRS-1) (Sun etal, 1991; Wang ‘tal, 19982). Addition of insulin or nsulin-ike growth fac- tor 1 (IGF-1) resulted in the tyrosine phospherylation of 4PS in myeloid col ines. Furthormor ‘2 myeloid cal line transtectec with the CDNA encoding IRS-* results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and its subsequent association withthe p85 subunit of PLOK, ‘suggesting thatthe IL-4R and the insulin receptor have partially overlapping signal transduction pathways and that IRS-1 and 4PS are functionaly sii thas recently been shown that IL-4 treatment can lead te phosphorylation of RS-1 in nonhematopoietic cells (Pussellatal., 1993). L cells express bothIL-4R andinsuiin receptor; however, they lack they. Lcslls demonstrated IRS-1 phosphorylation in response to insulin but not in response to IL-4. However, stable L ell transfectants that ‘xpress the 7. showed clear IRS-1 phosphoryation in re- ‘sponse to IL-4. These results indicate that IRS-t can be ‘a natural substrate for IL-4-medlated signaling, and they ‘how that the yi8 nt only associated withthe IL-4A but 's essential for certain forms of L-4-meciated signal rans- duction The importance of IRS in mediating the IL-4 signal",6

"September 9, 1982 To: Mr. E. J. Fackelman FROM: K. V. McCaffrey RE: Project AA With regards to your memo of September 2, let me say that while I don't disagree with the premise that imagery concepts are the most difficult to develop and refine on the down side, I do feel that the upside of Project AA has been completely overlooked. 1. To put it in your words, I view Project AA as being ""corrective"" imagery and not ""compatible"" imagery. If the designer name was Calvin Klein then I would say that AA is in a ""compatible"" image mode. However, Yves Saint Laurant is a high fashion Paris designer who is viewed as having distinctive sophisticated products which young adult female smokers want to be able to afford in their later years but cannot attain at this time. ‘The strength that I see in Project AA is a distinctive product coupled with a reinforcing image that could generate a very positive appeal. This premise is based on women's return to femininity. But I don't mean femininity in the traditional sense. Today's femininity includes not only physical attractiveness but also includes intelligence, independence, self-confidence and the ability to successfully lead a full, rich life. The sexual . revolution is not part of today's 18-24 year old woman. They assume that all avenues of opportunity are open to them but they want to project themselves as attractive women not neuter gender. 2. Project AA's main benefit to its target group is a cigarette that has a distinctively subtle taste (not overpowering) that is better than other brands on the market today. The reason or support for why this cigarette is better is due to the designer name influence. This influence causes expectations of a distinctive product that must be provided or consumers will feel they have been mislead. (As information, a formal positioning statement will be issued the week of September 13.) However, the bottom line is a subtly distinctive product with a subtly distinctive image carrier. 3. While it was known from the beginning that the odds of finding a solution to the 18-24 year old Corporate gap were minimal, Executive Management felt that at least we might gain some usable consumer information. Therefore, a rather rapid schedule was devised to not waste efforts if a solution did not appear quickly. znee LnZ0S",0

"COYNE BEAHM JOINS MAJOR CIGARETTE MANUFACTURERS IN LAWSUIT AGAINST THE FDA COLFAX, N.C., Aug. 10 /PRNewswite/ -- Coyne Beam Inc., a North Carolina-based advertising and marketing agency, has announced today that it has joined with the five major US. cigarette manufactures in filing a suit against the U.S. Food & Drug Administration and David A. Kessler, M.D.., the agency's ‘commissioner. The lawsuit was filed for the purpose of asking the court to declare that the FDA does not have the jurisdiction to regulate cigarettes. ""As an advertising and marketing agency, we fully agree with the tobacco companies that the Food and Drug Administration simply has no authority to regulate tobacco, nor activities related to it,"" said Roger Beahm, president of Coyne Beahm Inc. ""As we understand the FDA's proposed rules, they would have a significant effect on Our business. In addition to regulating the manufacturers, the FDA intends to regulate advertising and marketing agencies such as ours, and retailers who sell cigarettes. We believe the FDA simply does not have that authority. ""We all agree kids shouldn't smoke. If that is the objective of the FDA, these rules make it an objective designed to fail. The proposed regulations don't deal with the real factors affecting why kids smoke -- that is peer and family influences. While we recognize access is an issue, the tobacco companies are already implementing programs which research has shown to reduce underage access. It appears that rather than trying to take action which would really help keep cigarettes out of the hands of children, the FDA has decided to try to regulate not only the tobacco industry, but advertising and marketing agencies like ours, and retailers who are involved in the sale of cigarettes, We hope the FDA will reconsider, and that a truly workable plan designed to help keep cigarettes out of the hands of children can be agreed upon.” Coyne Beahm Inc. is a six-year-old advertising and marketing agency with offices in Nerth Carolina and New York.

The northeast sales region where complaints arc mainly from is represented by Don Fitzgerald who is not available until sometime Friday at the earliest. Andi asked me to not schedule a meeting for all parties to discuss until she and her future replacement Rebecca Fulton have a chance to talk to Don Fitzgerald first. Andi talked to someone who is at the ongoing Sales meeting where complaints were expressed, and said that they were stated as generalities - she is going to ask for specifics and any suggested changes. Andi said her preliminary feelings are that these will probably be mostly the same old complaints (""I don't think we should have to code invoices"", ""RR isn't paying vendors quickly”, ""Odd size invoices are hard to fax"", etc.) she has heard since the old “TPS"" system for paying sales office expense invoices was replaced months ago with the Disbursements Accounting system. ‘The old “TPS "" system was replaced because of serious control weaknesses that were costing the Company money. Some of the problems with the old system were: ‘overpayments, duplicate payments, field sometimes paid balances rather than invoices, vendor master set-up, payments to vendors in 2 days regandless of terms, retention of invoices for 7 years in sales offices, no BEO reporting, and no 1099 reporting. Currently invoices are received in the field, ledger-coded, approved, and faxed to Disbursements for payment. Perhaps there is room for improvement in the process; 1 am aware that consolidation of bills by vendors is currently under discussion in Disb Accounting. In summary, I expect to know more after Andi and Rebecca meet with Don Fitzgerald. ‘We will meet with Disb if necessary and will keep you informed. Zlos Zvoes",2

Poplar Hill Ra, 21210 May 1, 1972 Dr, Robert Hockett The Council for Tobacco Research 10 East 59th Street New York, New York 10022 Dear Bob: 1 received your letter April 7th asking for suggestions for research, Now, Bob, as you know, I have always been against the idea that the use of tobacco causes cancer of the lung. I think the statistical studies are not conducted properly, most of them are obtained from death certificates, Just because there is cancer in the lung does not mean that it was primary, it may have been from some other organ in the body, That is one point I think should be investigated, The other point is alveolar cell carcinoma which was reported in Akerman's studies on beagle dogs. It is irrelevant, I think, because Lord Brock in London did a study on alveolar carcinoma which occurs in sheep, and they call it sheeps' disease, He claims, and I think he is right, that it only occurs in animals that are chased or are chasers, which the beagle dog is; it is due to ruming, It is very rare in human beings and I have only seen one case in a doctor here in Baltimore in all of my experience, The third point is, if tobacco causes cancer in lungs why don't the poeple whe use snuff or chew tobacco, whose saliva is impregnanted with tobacco juice ever develop carcinoma of the esophagus or of the stomach? In the past they used to blame carcinoma of the lower lip on pipe smoking, haven't seen a case in years and there are more people smoking pipes now than ever before,",0

As we discussed, I am enclosing a proposal on the use of videocassettes as an advertising and promotional vehicle for RJR Nabisco. There are several major areas for consideratio! I. Direct Movie Advertising - Moonstruck (or other titles: The August release of ""Moonstruck"" on videocasesette (estimated to ship some 300-400,000 units) presents a rare opportunity: RJR Nabisco can place an ad for one of its food products on a film that just won three Academy Awards, has grossed over $71 million at the box office, and is the ""Best Picture"" (meaning best- suited among the Academy Award nominees) for the home video market. ""Moonstruck"" has broad appeal, high recognition and promotes strong, warm family values. It is an altogether pleasant viewing experience (totally inoffensive), which would be an appropriate associative link for an RJR Nabisco product. II. Promotion In the area of promotion, we are exploring the following types of offers with major advertisers: a) the offer of one cassette per month from our library of titles, for 12 months, as a premium to buyers of certain frequently used products; there isa ""buy-in"" of a minimum number of so many units 2106 O1Z0S",0

BRANDS DEVELOPMENT WINSTON Lights 65 Pilot Plant test write-ups were turned in this week for the RSM Designed PGT Study due to mail out 02/19/90. The design is a hexagonal with replicated midpoints to maximize utilization of the information gathered. Variables are (1) Reconstituted Sheet inclusion (at 6 levels) and (2) Puffed Tobacco inclusion (at 3 levels). The base blend is current WINSTON Lights 85 at a higher density than current. Previous learning suggested that the blend moisture level remain at current levels (12.75%). Products will be made the week of 02/05/90. Results are due 04/02/90. ur 8 Two R&D Confirmation products were made last week in the Pilot Plant and will be mailed to NFO the week of 01/15/90. Both of these prototypes met the short term action standard of parity acceptance to current WKS and parity puff count to Marlboro ks. one product is from a compilation of Full Flavor learning fron \ previous testing, primarily 1988 and 1989 development with HSB st information as a'base. It is a higher nicotine product with no é casing or top dressing and, combined with a lower moisture, y delivers ideal strength and tobacco taste. The second product “\ utilizes a new ammoniation process (on the reconstituted sheet portion) by application of DAP (diammonium phosphate)’ with the Current blend as a base. (The ammoniation currently in the flue- cured portion has been removed). Both of the above candidates are higher density products with lower puffed tobacco inclusion rate. Additionally, both utilize Hystar which is superior to glycerin in humectancy activity, and they use woodpulp cigarette paper with improved whiteness and brightness over currently used flax paper. f€€L T90Ts",0

Using ‘dominant inhibitory mutants of FGF signal transducers to disrupt the FGF-signaling pathway at the plasma ‘membrane or in the cytosol prevents animal eap blas- tomeres from expressing several mesodermal markers in response to exogenous activin. Dominant inhibitory ‘mutants of the FGF receptor, e-ras or e-raf inhibit the ability of activin to induce molecular markers of both dorsal and ventral mesoderm including Xbra, Mix! and Xnot. Some transcriptional responses to activin such as INTRODUCTION During early Xenopus development, cells in the equatorial region of the embryo adopt a mesodermal fate in response to inductive signals emanating from the underlying endoderm. As ‘mesodermal subtypes are regionally specified during this process and since mesoderm plays a critical role in gastrula ‘movements and neural induction, undestanding the nature of the inductive signals and their response is erucial 19 under- standing the molecular basis of pattern formation. ‘Several growth factors have been identified that can induce ‘mesoderm in explanted animal pole cells (animal caps) (reviewed 1989; Whitman and Melton, 1989). Two such factors, bFGF and activin, are present in the embryo during the time of mesoderm induction (Asashima et a., 1991; Kimelman et al., 1988; Slack et al., 1987). In animal cap assays, both FGF and low concentrations of activin are capable of inducing ventrolateral mesoderm such as mesenchyme, kidney and muscle, while only high concentrations of activin can efficiently induce dorsal mesodermal tissues such as notochord (Green ct al, 1990; Slack et al., 1987; Sokol et al., 1990). A wide variety’ of mesodermal response genes have been identified during revent years, many of which can be induced by either PGF or activin, These include Xbra (Smith etal, 1991), Xhox3 (Ruiz i Altaba and Melion, 1989), Xion (Costa et a, 1991) and Xn (von Dassow etal 1993) However, a subset of mesodermal marker genes, such as oosecoid (Cho etal, 1991) and Mex! (Rosa, 1989), appear 10 respond only to activin. Marker genes that respond solely 10 goosecoid and Xwni8 are inhibited less effectively than ‘others, however, suxuesting that there may differing requirements for an FGF signal in the responses of mesoderm-specific genes to activin induction. Despite the requirement for this signaling pathway during activin induction, downstream components ofthis pathway are not activated in response to activin, suggesting that activin does not signal directly through this pathway. Key words: activin, FGF, mesoderm induction, signal transduction, Xenopus dermal markers, this suggests an apparent redundancy between PGF und low level activin signaling, ‘The receptors for FGF and activin have been cloned and ‘encode a protein tyrosine kinase and a protein serine/threonine kinase, respectively (Lee et al., 1989, Matthews and Vale, 1991), Expression of dominant inbibitory mutants of these receptors has been shown to block ligand-mediated signaling, and this effect is rescued by co-expression of wild-type receptor, indicating that these receptors are indced responsible For inductive responses in embryonic cells (Amaya etal, 1991; Hemmati-Brivanlou and Melton, 1992). In embryos, expression of a dominant inhibitory PGF receptor percurbs posterior axial patterning (Amaya et al, 1991), while expression of a dominant inhibitory activin receptor can, in the most severe cases, completely block the formation of ‘mesoderm (Hemmati-Brivaniou and Melton, 1992). The latter result is striking in light of the fact that FGF-signaling pathways are stil functional in these embryos, Indeed, animal cap explants expressing a dorninant inhibitory activin receptor show increased responsiveness to exogenous FGF (Hemmati- Brivanlou and Melton, 1992), making the lack of FGI mesoderm in embryos expressing the dominant inhibitory activin receptor puzzling. ‘These results suggest that although FGF is capable of inducing mesoderm in animal cap assays. it may not do so in whale embryos. ‘One approach to elucidating the roles of FGF and activin during mesoderm induction is to examine and manipulate the cealy cytosolic responses to these growth factors. The activin receptor belongs t a novel family of (ransmembrane serine/threonine kinases and litte progress has becn made toward understanding how these receptors transmit signals",6

Although Clinton admitted that the chances of his cigarette Leaf Bulletin 99-22 tax hike passing Congress were slim to none, Senate Minority Leader ‘Tom Daschle (D-SD) said a cigarette tax albeit a smaller one is still salvageable. “Tthink the president acknowledged that maybe 55 cents the Republicans may not be able to accept, but there's along way from one cent to 58 cents.

Industry attorneys vigorously objected telling the panel that a single: award would cause an “enormous amount of irreparable harm tothe industry.” Analysts expressed surprise. The Negatives: Morgan Stanley Dean Witter analyst David Adelman described the decision as “the worst outcome of the appeal; {and it] was the least likely outcome.” Salomon Smith Bamey analyst Martin Feldman believes that the ruling will “substantially” increase litigation risks for the industry. “It's hard to identify a simple series of events that would lead toan industry victory,” said Feldman. “You are looking at a jury, that has already decided against the industry, being asked ‘how much?” That prospect is tough.” Feldman also doubted the likelihood of the Engle case being stripped of its class certification anytime soon. The Positives: Goldman Sachs analyst Mare Cohen said that the “ruling was narrow in scope and leaves open opportunity for the industry to pursue a separate appeal of the constitutionality of the Engle court's treatment of punitive damages on substantive merits...” Legal sources, he added, “strongly believe that the Engle court is going against FL statute and both US. Supreme Court and FL state court case precedent ...” Sanford Bernstein analyst Bill Pecoriello suggested that if the appeals court and the Florida Supreme Court do not significantly reduce a large punitive damage award and/or decertify the class, that the US. Supreme Court will ultimately reject any punitive damage verdict. “This,” wrote Pecoriello, “will mark the death of all tobacco class actions.” Stock Fallout: Tobacco stocks sank dramatically on the news. ber 20th, both Philip Morris Cos.

However, Cohen called tobacco, stock price declines “an unwarranted reaction to the developments in the Engle case. ... we continue to believe that this case will be resolved far more favorably than market trading implies.” A “far more positive landscape” is on the horizon than the one investors currently envision.

Key words: bovine forebrain/dexetimide/ digitonin Introduction ‘The neurotransmitter acetylcholine elicits rapid responses by interacting with nicotinic receptors (nAChRs) and slower effects via muscarinic receptors (mACHRs). Muscarinic responses are observed in the central and peripheral nervous, system as well as in muscle and in glands and representa large Proportion of the acetylcholine-mediated effects, Due to the extraordinarily high number of nAChRs found in the post synaptic membrane of the electromotor synapses of electric fish, knowledge of the mechanism and structure of nACHRS. hhas increased tremendously in recent years (Changeux, 1981). ‘Advances in research on mACHRs have been much less rapid. This is due to the lower concentration of mACARS, together with the fact that these receptors have not yet been purified. Earlier radioligand binding studies revealed that mACHRS are discrete membrane components which recognize an- tagonist and agonist molecules (Gorissen et al, 1978; Birdsall, et al., 1979; Haga, 1980). As is the case with many other receptor systems, the two types of ligands appear to differ in their mechanisms of interaction in the following way: only agonists induce receptor desensitization in intact cell prepara- tions (Klein et al., 1979; Simon and Klein, 1979); the recep tors are composed of different subpopulations with the same affinity for antagonists but different affinities for agonists (Birdsall e¢ al, 1978; Ehlert et a., 1981); guanine nucleotides ‘To whom rep requss shoud be sent © IRL Press Limo, Oxford, England, and Mg?* ions have opposite effects on agonist affinity but ‘no effect on antagonist binding (Ehlert er ai., 1981; Wei and Sulakhe, 1980; Sokolovsky et ai., 1980); and finally, agonists but not antagonists induce conformational changes in the receptors (Vauquelin et al, 1982). 'mACARS have been successfully solubilized with a wide variety of detergents, of which digitonin appears to be the ‘most effective (Gorissen et al., 1981; Ruess and Lieflander, 1979; Hurko, 1978; Aaronstam etal, 1978; Repke and Mat thies, 1980). ‘An affinity gel with high affinity for mACHRS (Repke et al, 1980) has been described recently and a Durifcation of hydrophobic MACHR and nACHR proteins ‘was attempted earlier (Barrantes ef al, 1975). We report here the first successful purification of mACHRS, These receptors were solubilized with digitonin, purified by absorption on an affinity get with dexetimide followed by selective elution with the MACHR antagonist atropine or with the highly specific Inreversible ligand propylbenzilyicholine mustard (PrBCM). ‘The radioiodinated purified proteins were analysed by SDS- polyacrytamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), Results Ligand binding characteris of the membrane-bound and solubilized mACHRS 55 a 10% membrane proteins and 15 + 5% of the total specie PH}dexetimide o PH}qunueldng!benzlate (QNB) binding activity were recovered in the supernatant of 3 190 (9) diatoninstested membrane suspension, ‘The equilbrium saturation binding data of studies on membrane-bound (a) and solubilized (¢) ACHRS wih PH\dexeimide are given in Figure 1A and B, respectively.

"CAmerican Heat. Journal September, 1980, Volume 100, Number 3 Editorial ‘Smoking and coronary heart disease: what are we to believe? Carl C. Seltzer, PhD? Cambridge, Mess. ‘Two recent events have raised serious questions ‘as to what we are to believe about the conven- tional view that cigarette smoking is a cause of coronary heart disease (CHD). Interpretation of ex-smoker: ‘The first event relates to the interpretation of ex-smoker data indicating that CHD mortality rates of persons who stopped smoking are substantially lower than those of persons who continued smoking. The interpretation given to these data is that smoking cessation directly results in the reduction of risk of heart disease mortality. The most commonly cited investiga tions in support of this line of thinking are the observational studies of Doll and Hill's British doctors Hammond's American men and wom- en,’ Kahe's U.S. veterans,’ and the Framingham Study.’ Underlying this alleged CHD benefit, however, is the assumption that ex-smokers are a representative sample of smokers, except in 20 far as they have stopped smoking. But the proof of the validity of this assumption has not been forthcoming. This is a crucial point in the comparison of the CHD outcomes in the two smoking groups. For, if the assumption of repre- sentativeness is invalid and significant baseline ferences are observed between ex-smokers and samokers for relevant factors, then the possibility Recs fa ubicton 2p 1,199, Regrnt meets: Caf €. Sekar, PRD. Harvard Usiety, 11 ‘Deut Roe Combe, Mas 28, ‘Hacer Senior Ravech Ameit, Harvard ivi. exists that the mortality comparison of ex-smok- ‘ers and continuing smokers is biased. For the first time in a very large series of subjects according to race and sex, we observed the proper baseline for the determination of whether or not ex-smokers were a representative ‘sample of smokers.” This baseline involved the study of the CHD-related characteristics of ex- smokers before they stopped smoking and their ‘comparison with those of persistent smokers. The results of this study are briefly reviewed below. Using the longitudinal records from the Kaiser- Permanente multiphasic health check-ups, the study compared 25 CHD-related characteristics of ex-smokers before they stopped smoking with ‘those of persistent smokers and nonsmokers. A total of more than 25,000 subjects, white men and women, black men and women, with three or more consecutive health check-ups formed the basis of the analysis. For the criteria of the classification ofthe subject, the designated “in- dex examination,” and the list of CHD-related characteristic, the reader is referred to the publi- cation? The minimum of three or more examina- tions was used in order to insure a rigorous classification of the smoking categories. Thus, examokers (peristent quitters) were subjects who had at least one examination at which they reported both a current and past history of Cigarette smoking, followed by at least two exam- {nations in which they reported complete cessa- tion of smoking. The CHD-related characteristics fell into arbitrary categories: cardiovascular manifestations (blood pressure, hypertension, American Heart Journal 278 MASTER-SPP 002015 11063829",6

"7-— WHICH SIDE ARE YOU ON? Should Teenagers Start Smoking? To smoke or not to smoke? That’s the question many people are asking themselves these days. They know it might be a matter of life and death to them. And it's no secret that some of these people aren't any older than you. Our information for the “No” side was obtained by interviewing a man who quit smoking three years ago after puffing two packs a day for 15 years. We couldn't think of any arguments for the “Yes” side. Can you? Which side are you on? ""The fun and pleasure of ‘not smoking far outweigh the pleasure of two packs @ day. The non-smoker enjoys food so much more. He has more en- ergy to do things that are much more satisfying than puffing a weed. He sleeps more soundly. ‘He usually doesn’t catch as many ‘colds. He doesn’t get winded as easily and so can do better in sports, Usually he doesn’t annoy himself and others with a rasp- ing cough. In the. morning his mouth does not taste like the in- side of an old pair of gloves. He is calmer, more poised, more con- fident than many smokers. ‘The non-smoker saves money —as much as $200 a year! ‘And don’t forget that a mere two or three cigarettes a day fre- quently lead to two or three packs a day. ‘But there is a much more ser- ious reason for not smoking cig- arettes. ‘They can kill you. No victim of the stabbing pain of lung cancer would be likely to advise you to smoke, The smoker ‘also has more reason to fear heart attacks and diseases that attack the lungs such as bron- chitis and emphysema. The death rate for men who began smok- ing when they were teenagers is 100 percent higher than that of non-smokers. °As a non-smoker you can hope for a longer life filled with the real pleasures of not smoking. ‘And your growing confidence and poise will spring, not from ‘the flimsy crutch of nicotine, but from you. @ YOUNG caTHoL. messencen DAYTON, OHIO we 808,300 MAR4 1365 TIMN 280272",9

"June 22, 1987 TO: Mr. R. J. Reagan RE: SSIT Trip - Equipment Inventory/Product Costing As part of our recent trip to SSIT's Janesville facilities, Ernie Farrier and I were able to inspect and review accounting records of the equipment described on pages 1 and 2 (attachments) « During the course of our inspection and review, it became evident that one piece of equipment (High Speed Feeder) costing $20,127.00 had not been properly billed. SSIT is currently preparing an invoice for this equipment and it will be forwarded for payment as soon as possible. An inventory of the equipment at Creedmoor has been tentatively scheduled for June 23rd. Appropriate tag numbers for each piece of equipment are being provided by the Janesville office to ensure continuity. Future purchases of equipment will be tagged accordingly, It appears that SSIT is making a concerted effort to properly maintain records on purchased equipment in compliance with the contract provisions. I also had an opportunity to discuss with Mr. Bruce Hamilton about the urgent need for accurate and consistent reporting of expenses relating to development. I believe it (reporting) is critical because the information generated will be used as part of the data base for projecting the cost of fuel sources onan ongoing basis (one billion units per month). Mr. Hamilton and I have agreed to have a follow-up discussion of this issue in Creedmoor on June 23rd. E M, Moére MMz1r Attachment . cc: wf. E.G. Farrier > a Mr. M: E.

Reynolds Tobacco Company Winston-Salem, NC 27102 Dear Cliff: Enclosed ts the proposal that you requested on *Developsent and Evaluation of Process Concepts for Removal of CO from Cigarette Smoke’. Our approach to this problem is materials oriented. We feel that meeting the objective for this Program will be quite challenging. Nevertheless, because of the strong experience of our proposed research team in closely related catalysis and mate- rial developeent programs, we feel reasonably confident that one or two con cepts for sorbents or catalysts may be demonstrated as feasible. We have structured this program based on a concept development phase and an experimental phase. The project timeline as shown in Figure 1 indicates two milestones or decision points. On a project of this coaplexity, it is neces- Sary to maintain good communications on our progress toward these decision points. In addition to monthly reports and meetings, phone discussions will be used as needed to keep the RJR technical liaison posted on important develop- ments on this project. The searches that you sent us were useful in assisting us in estisating the fuaber of possible references available in a literature search on CO removal from cigarette saoke. It was also useful to note the categories of materials evaluated for sorbents or catalysts. This study is proposed for authorization as a Task under Task Order Agreement No. S48-P-O499R existing between RIR and Battelle. Your return of a fully signed original of this cover letter or providing your letter of authorization, referencing the proposal identification number and the Task Order Agreement, wil] authorize us to start work on this program.

"January 11, 1984 To: Mr. R. M. Sanders FROM: Mr. W. F, Bultman ""RESEARCH RESULTS SUBJECT: SUMMARY OF AND PERSPECTIVE ON “SPORTS PAG! BACKGROUND: “ports Page” is a unique advertising medium developed for WINSTON by 13-30 Corporation. The medium {s essentially a series of posters covering sports related topics; a WINSTON ad appears at the bottom third of the poster. These posters are placed in wall-mounted displays in bars, delis, convenience Stores, bowling alleys and factory breakrooms ~ locations frequented by WINSTON's younger adult male target. As of July, 1983, 5,000 “Sports Page” displays were placed in these locations across 25 major metros. [NOTE: The posters are updated and changed bi-weekly.] ‘Two pieces of research were conducted to evaluate the efficiency and effect- iveness of “Sports Page”. A. A“Sports Page” Traffic Audit was conducted to determin 1) the number of people, particularly males 18-34 years old (WINSTON'Ss target), coming within an established distance of “Sports Page” displays on a daily basis and, 2) to determine the condition and readability of the “Sports Page” displays. This research was key to the contractual agreement between RJR and 13-30 Corporation, as explained in the Action Standards below. B. A “Sports Page” Awareness and Readership Study was conducted to determine Gureness of “Sports Page” among males, 18-34, awareness of WINSTON’s Sponsorship, depth of involvement with the “Sports Page” poster (e.g often read and for how long) and attitudes toward “Sports Page” (e.g. an appealing, informative and entertaining medium). how as ACTION STANDARDS: A. The “Sports Page” Traffic Audit These action standards or “guarantees” are excerpted verbatim from the contract with 13-30 Corporation. © The average audited traffic passing “Sport's Page” locations will be at Yeast 50 persons per day. Traffic must be within a distance of not more than 35 feet and must be in an unobstructed line of sight. Wall- mounted displays must be sufficiently accessible to the traffic such that reading of the articles in “Sports Page” may occur. 09s ¢900s",0

"Vv ¢,\ C ~ February 16, 1978 Mr. Harold C, Pillsbury Director Federal Trade Commission Tobacco Research Laboratory Sixth Street and Pennsyl- vania Avenue Washington, D.C. 20580 Dear Mr, Pillsbury: Reference is made to your letter of January 12, 1978, soli- a citing information necessary in the preparation of the Federal Trade Commission's reports of ‘tar’ and nicotine con- tent of the smoke of currently-marketed cigarettes. In re- sponse to the Commission's solicitation, Lorillard encloses herewith a summary list of Lorillard's cigarette varieties currently being sold in the United States. Please take note that certain of Lorillard's varieties enjoy ventilated filters, and care mst be taken to assure that air vent holes are not covered. Ventilation measurements are specifically noted in the “Filter Type” column of the attached cigarette specifications. We call your attention to TRUE 85's Regular and Menthol, TRUE 100's Regular and Menthol, KENT GOLDEN LIGHTS 85's Regular and Menthol, NEWPORT LIGHTS and OLD GOLD LIGHTS. ‘The: varieties must be inserted into the rubber dam holder at a depth of no more than 7 mm from the filter end so as to pre- vent covering holes while smoking. This is in accordance with the recitation of the procedure for testing Tar and Nicotine in Cigarette Smoke, by H. C. Pillsbury et al., which in the last full sentence of the second paragraph of the section sub-headed, ""Preparation of Sample"", states: PST6LSE0 “Cigarettes manufactured with air vent holes must be inserted carefully to prevent cover- ina holes while smoking.""

"‘TANAPOLIS STAR, Jack Anderson PAGE 9 Ignoring smoking warnings Washington — The tobacco com- panies’ long. deliberate campaign to undereut government warnings on the hazards of cigarette smoking has been astonishingly successful, ac- cording to internal industry ‘doc- uments that have been suppressed by court order. ‘The Federal Trade Commission recently reported that the health ‘waming on every pack of cigarettes is ineffective, and the industry's own studies support this conclusion, But 2 federal judge acceded to the tobac- co companies’ request that doc- uments subpoenaed by the FTC be locked up. The section of the agen cey's report that discusses the doc- uments has also been withheld from the public. My associate Tony Capaccio has seen the suppressed material. One document in particular illustrates just how ineffective the govern: ment’s many warnings about ciga- Fettes have been. It is a 1977 survey by the firm of Yankelovich, Skelly and White for the Brown & Wiliam ‘son Tobaceo Corp. Here are some of its findings: * NEARLY ONE-FOURTH of the nation’s cigarette smokers do not believe that smokers die younger than non-smokers. Twenty-two percent of the gen- ‘eral population, including 32 percent of smokers, were not aware that ‘smoking increases the risk of any type of cancer. ‘* Twenty-three percent of the population (and 38 percent of smok- fers) believed the statement, “They. still haven't proven that smoking. ‘causes lung cancer.” * Thirty-eight percent of the population (and nearly half the T smokers) did not know that smoking increases the risk of heart disease. * A particularly reprehensible feature of the cigarette companies"" ‘multimilliondollar advertising cam- Paigns has been their accent on youth — devising means to hook ‘young people on the smoking habit For example, a 1975 ad plan pre- Many still do not believe that smokers die younger than non-smokers. pared for Brown & Williamson sug- ested these ways to attract “start- ers” to smoke Viceroy cigarettes, “Present the cigarette as one of the few initiations into the adult world.” * “TO THE BEST of your abili- ty, relate the cigarette to ‘pot,’ wine, beer, sex, etc.” = “Don't communicate health or health related points.” The word “Don’t was underlined for empha- sis ‘The suppressed section of the FTC report has this to add: “B&W documents show that it translated the advice on how to attract ‘start. ers"" into an advertising campaign featuring young adults in situations that the vast'majority of young People probably would experience and in situations demonstrating adherence to a ‘free and easy, hedonistic lifetyle."""" Another example of the cigarette makers’ deliberate targeting of young people is his quote from the “Through the association of Salem and its brand styles with emulatable personalities that are ‘compatible with the aspirations and styles of contemporary young adults. this important target seg. ment will be attracted to the brand. * EXECUTIVE MEMO — A former Senate aide who was accused of offering classified information to Is- Faeli officials in 1978 has been a consultant to the Defense Depart- ment and is in line for a sensitive, full-time position at the Pentagon, He is Stephen Bryen, who was work: ing for the Foreign Relations Com mittee when the charges were made A former lobbyist for the National Association of Arab-Americans swore in an affidavit that he over- heard Bryen, in Washington's Mad- ison Hotel, offer Israeli officials document ‘on Arab military bases Bryen denied any wrongdoing, and was cleared by the FBI. He is now'a consultant to Richard Perle, acting assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs. Perle said the 1978 charges were “a scahe dalous attack initiated by a pro. fessional lobbying organization 's White House budget-cutters ap parently want to dismantle the anti- Poverty Community Services Agen- cy, despite the nomination of a new CSA assistant chief. Congressional investigators also want a closer look at the agency's books. They've al ready uncovered serious misman- agement, and now suspect there's fraud in some of the agency's com tracts as well. TIMN 202631",9

All compounds were assayed both in the presence, and absence of liver homogenate from Aroclor-treated rats. Among the aminocarbazoles, 2-aminocarbazole was found to be most active in both tester strains, although somewhat less active than 2-aminofluorene. 3-Aminocarbazole was the only other isomer that was mutagenic towards TA98 at the dose levels employed (5-200 jg). 4-Aminocarbazole was moderately active in TA100, and I-aminocarbazole was inactive in both TA98 and TA100. Similar differences in mutagenic potency and specificity towards the tester strains were observed for the related series of nitrocarbazoles. ‘The mutagenic and carcinogenic activity of various heterocyclic aromatic amines has been actively investigated in recent years, The isolation and structural elucida- tion of 3-amino-SH-pyrido[4,3-6lindoles, 2-amino-dipyridof1,2-a:3',2""-d imidazoles, 2-amino-5-phenylpyridine, 2-amino-9H-pyridol2,3-bjindoles, and 2-amino-imidazo- [45 Jquinotines (Sugimura et al., 1977; Yamamoto ‘et al., 1978; Yoshida et al, 1978; Kasai et al., 1980) as potent mutagenic components present in protein Pyrolysates and cooked food have contributed to interest in their potential ‘toxic effects.

Copying, storing, redistribution, retransmission, publication, transfer or commerical exploitation ofthis information is expressly forbidden. By Andrew Evans, Lords Staff, PA News ‘The next Labour Government will seek to improve the health ofthe nation's poorest families by banning tobacco advertising, Opposition health spokesman Baroness Jay of Paddington pledged tonight Lady Jay, opening a Lords debate on poverty and ill health, told peers: “itis <isgracetul that the Government has not taken tougher action to curb smoking. An incoming Labour Government will ban tobacco advertising as a priority in our public health policy."" ‘There would also be a new Minister of Public Health ""to lead public health policy at the national level and to coordinate local action as well as to encourage good practice"". Labour would also “review and re-publish” the Government's 1982 Health of the Nation’ stratogy in 1998, to coincide withthe 50th anniversary of the start ofthe National Health Service. ‘The new version was likely to follow the Australian strategy, which called for action in five areas: distribution of economic resources, education, lving standards, conditions of ‘work, and social support “This approach would reflect our determination to make improved health a central goal ofall social policy,” Lady Jay declared, “We wil aim to reduce poverty and inequality through a commitment to help people move trom welfare to work: to end poverty pay by introducing a national minimum wage ‘and to improve housing conditions by the phased release of local authority capital receipts.” Lady Jey went on:""The embition is o ensue that these meesures inavicualy produce improvements in the health of our poorest families and that together they create more equity and a more inclusive socioty. “To achieve an inclusive society where everyone, not just the advantaged and affluent, has the opportunity to achieve their greatest health would indeed be a victory for socal justice, Lady Jay's pledge on tobacco advertising was later attacked by the president of the Motor Sport industry Association, Tory Lord Astor of Hever, who warned that it would have a “devastating effect"" on an industry which was a “real Bish success story” Lady Jay, daughter of former Labour Prime Minister Lord Callaghan of Cardi, had cealior spoken of a “stark health divide"" between the richest and poorest sections of society. The average life expectancy of the richest 10% was eight years longer than forthe ‘poorest 10%, and the poorest were more than twice as likely to de early. Halt of Britain's children, some four millon, were being brought up in poverty, often in single-parent househoids. Lady Jay, a heaith authority vice-chairman, stressed: “thas litle to do with the performance of the NHS.” tt was more to do with unemployment, bad housing, lack of nutrtious food, and insecurity. “All the evidence shows that when poor familias get poorer, their first economy is food,"" she said. But perhaps the Government’ “single greatest falure™ was is failure to tackle the tobacco industry. “Today smoking is predominantly a habit of the poor. And conventional health ‘education will have vary lite impact on disadvantaged people who may see cigarettes as ‘an important prop in dificut ives.""

SEMENZA* Center fr Mesa Ge Communicated by Vicor A. MeKutick, February 11,1993 ABSTRACT Transcription of the human erythropoietin (EPO) gene is activated in Hep3B cells exposed to hypoxia.

Calls sense and respond to extracellular and intracellular stimli (© maintain homeostasis. and hypoxia is one of the ‘most fundamental of all environmental stimuli. A major physiologic mechanism by which mammals respond to tissue hypoxia is through stimulation of erythropoiesis resulting in fan increased blood Oy-carrying capacity. Erythropoietin (EPO) the primary humoral regulator of mammalian eryth- Topoiesis. EPO RNA levels increase several hundredfold in ‘rodent liver and kidney in response to hypoxia or anemia (for review. see refs. 1 and 2). Human EPO RNA levels show ‘similar increases in transgenic mouse liver and kidney (3-6). Hypoxia also induces EPO RNA transcription in Hep3B ‘human hepatoblastoma cells (7), demonstrating thatthe same cell type can sense hypoxia and respond by increasing EPO RNA levels. The production of EPO and subsequent increase in erythropoiesis thus provide a major homeostatic mecha nism for maintaining issue oxygenation. ‘A major research objective in our laboratory has been to identify the cis-acting DNA sequences and trans-acting pro- tein factors that regulate hypoxia-inducible human EPO gene expression. Liver-specific DNase -hypersensitive sites have been identified in the human EPO gene 3'-flanking sequence (8).

The HIF-1 binding site, as established by transient expression and electrophoretic. ‘mobility-shift assays (EMSAs) (9) is completely conserved in the enhancer of the mouse EPO gene (10). Treatment of Hep3B cells with cycloheximide inhibited the hypoxic induc- tion of both EPO RNA (7) and HIF-1 DNA binding acuvity (9), These results provided further evidence for the impor- {ance of HIF-1 in EPO gene transcriptional activation by hypoxia and suggested that induction of HIF-1 activity ‘quires de novo protein synthesis. ‘A growing number of other mammalian genes have been Feported whose expression is induced by hypoxia (11-15). ‘The molecular basis for induction has not been established for any of these genes, although induction of vascular endo- thelial growth factor RNA is inhibited by cycloheximide (14). To determine whether HIF-1 plays a general role in the hypoxic activation of gene transcription, we have analyzed ‘mammalian cell ines in which the EPO gene is nat expressed. HIF-1 was induced by hypoxia in all cell lines tested, including human 293 embryonic kidney and HeLa cervieal carcinoma cells, mouse Ltk~ fibroblasts, and C:Cy skeletal ‘myoblasts, Ratl fibroblasts, and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The physiological relevance of HIF-1 induction was supported by our demonstration that the hypoxia- inducible enhancer was functional in CHO and 293 eels, whereas the 3-nt mutation that eliminated HIF-1 binding rendered the enhancer noninducible. These results implicate HIF-Lin the transcriptional regulation of gene expression by hypoxia in a variety of mammalian cell types. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell Culture and Nuclear Extract Preparation, Hep3B and HeLa cells were maintained in minimal essential medium with Barle’s salts, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM L-glutamine, ‘and 1 mM nonessential amino acids. 293, Ratl, C3Ci, and LLtk- cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium.

"HPN pray , Y EIQBISFLAHice Memorandum Subject: Proposed Formation of a GC-MS Spectroscopy _ Date: July 15, 1975 Working Group To: Dr. Anders H. Laurene From: Dr. C. R. Green Dr. Alan Rodgman Memorandum: For at least the last five years the Analytical Division has provided mass spectral analysis as a service to the Chemical Division. Since the usage of glass capillary gas chromatography has become more common the chromatographers have found that they must work more and more closely with the mass spectroscopist. In fact, the mass spectrometer has become the detector of choice for glass capillary gas chromatography. These two areas have become so closely allied that the quality of the chromatographic results are often limited by the mass spectral data and conversely the quality of the mass data is often limited by the efficiency of the chromatographic columns. For these reasons I propose the formation of a GC-MS spectroscopy working group consisting of Fred Thome, George Young and myself. The long-range goals of this group would be as follow: 1, Continue research into the preparation of efficient, stable and inert glass capillary columns. 2, Continue research into techniques for the best utilization of glass capillary columns such as ""splitless injection"" and “closed loop"" headspace sampling (not Tenax). 3. Prepare glass capillary columns for all members of the Research Dept. and give advice for their proper and full utilization. 4. Prepare glass capillary colums especially for use with the mass spectrometer. 5. Develop improved techniques for interfacing glass capillary columns to the mass spectrometer. 6. Develop the techniques of combined GC-Specific Ion mass spectroscopy. 7. Develop the techniques of combined GC-Chemical Ionization mass spectroscopy. 9686 96205 IRI FORM 2422-Rev. 7/70",0

FISCHER, S.R. WAGLE* and N.R. KATZ Institut fir Biochemie der Universitaet, Hunboldtallee 7, D-3400 GBttingen, PRG Received August 22, 1983 The coll number as well as the hexokinase and glucokinase activity of liver parenchymal and nonparenchymal cells were studied in metha~ Pyrilene treated rats. The ntmber of nonparenchymal cells was doubled after treatment with methapyrilenc for two weeks while that of hepa= tocytes remained constant. The hexokinase activity was increased fourfold in the nonparenchymal cell fraction while it was unchanged in the parenchymal cells. The glucokinase activity was decreased in the hepatocytes to one third. Hence, the increased hexokinase acti- vity was due to a proliferation of nonparenchymal cells rather than to a toxic dedifferentiation of hepatocytes. = The antihistaminic drug methapyrilene was used therapeutically until its carcinogenic potency was recognized a few years ago. After long-term administration to rats hepatocelluler carcinomas develop (1). However, long before preneoplastic foci occur, toxic alterations are observed mainly in the periportal zone of the liver acinus (2). These morphological changes are accompanied by an inversion of the metabolic zonation, which is indicated by an increase in hexokinase (Bc 2.7.1.1) in the periportal zone and decrease of glucokinase (Bc 2.7.1.2) in the perivenous zone of the liver acinus (2). How ever, no conclusive information is available, whether the increase of hexokinase is due to parenchymal (PC) or to nonparenchymal cells (eC). Therefore, in the present study, the hexokinase and the gluco- kinase activities were determined in parenchymal and nonparenchymal cells separated tro livers of methapyrilene treated animals. the hexokinase was increased fourfold in the nonparenchymal cell fraction by enhancement of the nonparenchymal cell number as well as by an Ancrease of the collular level of the enzyme. On the other hand the hexokinase activity present in parenchymal cells was not changed throughout the experiment, while the glucokinase activity was sig- nificantly reduced. “Visiting senior Fulbright guest professor from Dept. of Pharmacology, Indiana University, School of Medicine, Indianapolis, USA 0006-2914/83 $1.50 Copyright © 1983 by Academic Pres, In Allrighs of reproduction in any form reserved. 1090 50279149",6

"7 choc ph, Qf Perey VV. 1966 THE CIRCULATORY RESPONSE TO SMOKING: THE EFFECT OF SMALL DOSES OF HEXAMETHONIUM AND OF MEPHENTERMINE ON THE PATTERN OF RESPONSE CAROLINE. BeDELL THOMAS, M.D., AND From the Department of Madicine, g Bape. 7 uD. The’ Johns Hophins University Schock Epatonn A. Menpay, M.D. one Baxtotons, Mp. (Received for pubtication Apri 1900) JURING a standard ballistocardiographic smoking test, many different ‘types of circulatory response are found among healthy young adul Some subjects show hyperreactivity of the blood pressure, heart rate, or cardiae ‘output in various combinations, While others with similar smoking habits show Tittle change or even a negative responce. The variations in circulatory reactivity undoubtedly reflect individual differences in homeostasis which may be of con- siderable importarice, particularly: in regard to susceptibility to future hyper- tension or coronary artery dincase. In 1988, Herrell demonstrated that certain Persona with “a tendency toward” hypertension showed dramatic rises of blood Preasure after omoking a cigarette, and in the eame year, Hines and Roth reported, that the most marked elevation of blood pressure during a standard emoking test occurred among patients with essential hypertension. We found that the degree of change in cardiae output in healthy medical students following amoking may’ be related to genctic factora.* Thus the offepring of hypertensive parents showed an exaggerated increase in cardiac output after one cigarette as well a A greater rise in Dlood pressure and heart rate when compared with the offepring oftunaffected parente, On the other hand, the offepring of parents with coronary artery disease showed a more marked diminution in stroke volume and a much smatler increase iy cardiac output after smoking than did the offepring of un- Affected parents. Accordingly. differences in reaponse to the smoking test may be of predictive value in regard to the development of hypertension oF coronary disease at an carly age, on the one hand, or as an index of longevity and relative freedom from cardiovascular disease on the other.

The Leptomonas collosoma Spliced Leader RNA Can Switch between Two Alternate Structural Formst Karen A. LeCuyer and Donald M. Crothers"" Department of Chemistry, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut 06511 Received November 12, 1992; Revised Manuscript Received February 10, 1993 ApsTract: We have used a combination of physical and motecular biological techniques to examine the structure of Leptomonas collosoma spliced leader RNA. We confirm the general features of the previously proposed structure for the 3’ half of the RNA, in which a single-stranded region is flanked by two stem loops. However, we find that the 5’ half of the RNA, which contains the spice site, has two competing secondary structures which differ only slightly in stability and which can interconvert on a fast (<1 s) time scale, In the favored conformation, a stable hairpin helix is augmented by conserved complementarity between the splice site and the S’end ofthe SL RNA. This putative helix has anomalous nuclease sensitivity and thermal stability features, suggesting that itis probably coupled by unknown tert other nucleotides in the 5? half-molecule, The structure offers intriguing parallels with RNA-RNA. 5301 interactions in the mammalian splicing system. Pre-mRNA splicing sa processby which anintron sexcised and the exons are then ligated [reviews: Padgett etal. (1986); Maniatis and Reed (1987)]; intermediates in the cs splicing reaction have been well characterized. The trans splicing reaction of trypanosomes and nematod involves the transfer of a 5’ exon (22-41 nuclot froma short (<200 nucleotide) spliced leader transcript onto 4 preexisting mRNA (Konarska etal, 1985; Murphy eta, 1986; Sutton & Boothroyd, 1986). In trypanosomes all of themature mRNAs contain the spliced leader at their ends. A trans spliced leader is also found in a small pereentage of nematode mRNAs (Kraus & Hirsh, 1987; Blumenthal & ‘Thomas, 1988). ‘The proposed secondary structure for the kinetoplastid spliced leader (SL) RNAS (Bruzik et al, 1988) was based upon relative free energies predicted by the Fold program (Zuker, 1989) and upon conservation ofthe folding pattern for several SL RNAs. This structural conservation among the trypanosomatid SL RNAs is striking due tothe lack of length and sequence homology ouside ofthe spliced leader exon portion of the molecule, The proposed secondary structure contains three stem loops, the second and third of which flank a single-stranded region which has the sequence ofa binding ste for Sm proteins (Mattaj, 1988). The latter arecommon splicing proteins that areimmunoprecipitable by antibodies found in the serum of certain autoimmune patients (Lemer & Stcitz, 1979). In vitro assembly of SL RNA snRNPs with HeLa cell Sm proteins, followed by immuno- precipitation with anti-Sm antibodies (Bruzik eta, 1988), shows that the putative Sm protein binding site of the SL RNAsisactiveinproteia binding. U! independenceof splicing the trans spliced leader to an adenovirus exon in cis has also been demonstrated using Ul-depleted HeLa cell extracts (Bruzik & Steitz, 1990). This result led to the proposal that {he functional domain for 5 splice site identification in trans splicing resides in the SL sa RNP itself and not ina UI RNA sa RNP.

This approach yielded the predicted results for the 3 but not the 5’ half of the molecule. We also examined the thermal unfolding equilibria and kinetics for the molecule, ‘using the temperature-jump (T-jump) technique, in which ‘thesampleis rapidly heated and the optical changeis measured asa function of time. We found a low-temperature thermal transition which could not be accounted for by unfolding of Ihelies in the model of Bruzik et al. (1988), Subsequent experiments localized this effect to the 5’half of the molecule. We then employed mutagenesis and polyacrylamide gel clectrophoresis methods such as ribonuclease mapping (Douth- waite & Garrett, 1981; Celander & Cech, 1990) and base rmodification/interference experiments (Peattie, 1979; Conway & Wickens, 1989; Weeks et al., 1990) to probe the structure ofthe S‘halfof LeptomonascollosomaSLRNA. We propose anew structure in which a stable hairpin helix is augumented by pairing of the 5’ end of the SL RNA with the spice site. ‘The hairpin helix has a measured Ty about 6 °C higher than the analogous helix proposed by Broziketal. (1988). However, the putative splice site helix bas unusual properties, including ‘anomalously small thermal stability changes upon mutation, single-strand nuclease sensitivity a the splicesite,and apparent tertiary interactions with additional nucteotides in the 5"" half of the SLRNA. We speculate that the internal spice site pairing may be analogous to pairing ofthe 5’ end of Ul with the 5’ splice site in mammalian pre-mRNA splicing (Zhuang & Weiner, 1986), MATERIALS AND METHODS DNA Oligonucleotides.

(E) Light Seattering KR. W. Detenbeck The scientific study of light scattering began in 1869 with the experiments of Tyndall, who sent a beam of white light through a suspension of fine particles. The scattered light ‘sas bluish and, observed at right angles to the beam, was, hichly polarized. These effects suggested to Tyndall thatthe ‘Nue color and polarization of ight from the sky are produced 1m the scattering of sunlight by atmospheric dust. In a sub- sequent, theoretical treatment Rayleigh calculated the scat- ‘ering from a random collection of small (compared with a \savclength), widely separated spheres. He predicted the ob- served polarization phenomena, as well as the inverse- fourth-power dependence of scattered intensity on wave- length which gives the sky its blue color. That the blue color an4 Polarization were most striking in the clearest skies led sleigh to conclude that the molecules of air itself, not “led dust particles, are responsible for the blue sky. Wavefronts propagate straightforward within a homoge- ‘ous medium, and the effect of the medium is described {erm ofits average electromagnetic properties. Light se ‘ers when it passes through a medium that contains inho- Light Scattering 635 rogeneities on the scale of a wavelength, These may be embedded particles as in Tyndall's scattering experiments, ‘or the molecules of the medium itself, as in Rayleigh’s theory Of the blue sky, However, Rayleigh’s molecular theory ap- plies only to gases, where itis proper to add the intensities of light scattered by individual molecules. In condensed mat- ter the medium is quite homogeneous on the scale of optical ‘wavelengths, and the coherent addition of scattered ampli- tudes cancels radiation inal but the forward direction. Using 2 different model suggested by Smoluchowski, Einstein in 1910 described the weak light scattering from liquids in terms of thermodynamic density fluctuations within small volume elements of a continuous medium Descriptions of light-scattering phenomena can be clas sified as static or dynamic. Static descriptions include time- averaged angular distributions of scattered intensity and po- larization. One interesting case is the scattering of linearly polarized light from a single particle, ilustrated in Fig. 1. IF the scattering takes place within a surrounding medium of index re, and the vacuum wavelength of the incident light ‘beam is Ao, the incident wave vector has magnitude ky = 2ranlhy. The scattered light has wavelength As, and the mag- nitude of ts wave vector is ks = 2an/As. The incident beam propagates in the direction of the vector ko, and the scattered light travels from the particle to the detector inthe direction of ks. The two wave vectors determine the scattering plane, in which the scattering angle between them is denoted by 8. Inacommon arrangement the incident light is polarized with its electric field aligned along the normal to the scattering plane, often called the vertical direction and denoted here by the unit vector ey. The detector may select either the vertically polarized component or the horizontal component, with electric field aligned along ey. Electromagnetic scattering from a particle remains an in- teresting theoretical problem in itself. The exact solution for the scattering from an isolated sphere was obtained by Mie in 1908, but the only other exact solution fora finite particle, an ellipsoid of revolution, awaited the work of Asano and LIGHT SOURCE Dw % 4 DETECTOR s tS K Fic. 1.

CORP wy Behavior Genetics, Vol. 25, No. 2, 1995 The Psychopharmacological Basis of Nicotine’s Differential Effects on Behavio Individual Subject Variability in the Rat John A. Rosecrans' w a gegen HN et rer wile fa ‘COPYRIGHT HOLDER Ee ee ea Scoot ‘Nicotine, the presumed active pharmacological agent in tobacco, produces variable effects fon behavior that are at best described as “‘paradoxical""” in nature, Thus, nicotine, via tobacco use in humans or nicotine administration in experimental animals, tends to trans- pose behavior depending on predrug baseline rates of behavior. High rates of behavior appear to be reduced, while low rates of behavior appear to be increased by nicotine. This work further proposes that nicotine’s variable effects on behavior may be related to its capacity to act as a behavioral agonist and/or antagonist via its ability either to activate or to desensitize distinct central nicotinic acetyleholinergic receptors (nACHR's). ‘Nicotine is portrayed as a neuronal modulating agent that can affect behavior contingent uupon the genetic makeup of the individual subject being studied. Depending on the structure, function, and location of distinct mAChR’s, nicotine appears to be able to induce 1 wide range of behavioral effects important to the tobacco user. However, this does not rule out the role the importance that other biogenic amine systems (j.e., serotonin or dopamine) may have in the genetics of tobacco use or nicotine’s variable effects on behavior. KEY WORDS: Nicotine; smoking; nicotinic receptors; behavior, desensitization; serotonin; ine dividual variabily. INTRODUCTION The use of nicotine via its presence in tobacco has been both engaging and enigmatic to many re- searchers over the last 30 years. Its behavioral ef- fects in man appear to be “paradoxical” in nature (Robinson and Pritchard, 1992), i.e., some individ- uals appear to be aroused by nicotine (via smoking) while others are sedated following similar dosing patterns. Tobacco use has also had an important societal funetion in Native American and West In- dian cultures and has served man well in times of crisis (Klein, 1993). As pointed out by Klein, “‘General Pershing once wrote that they (cigarettes) ""Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Virginia Com- ‘monwealth University, Richmond, Virginis 23298-0615, 187 were as vital to his troops as food.”” Even Shamans in South America have employed tobacco use for centuries as a means of warding off the evil spirits * believed to cause disease in these tribal societies (Wilbert, 1987). Thus, nicotine has a rich phar- macological history of use in man, at least via the use of tobacco. Nicotine’s “paradoxical” nature has also been observed at the molecular level in studies evaluat- ing its effects at the nicotinic acetylcholinergic re- ‘ceptor (nACHR’s). Marks ef al. (1985), for exam- ple, were the first to note that chronic nicotine administration was capable of inducing an up-reg- ulation (increase in the number of receptors) of central nACBR’s. The molecular mechanism of, RACHR up-regulation appears to be related to ni- POSEETISOS",6

THE RESPONSE OF MURINE SPLENIC LYMPHOCYTES TO CONCANAVALIN A AND TO CO-STIMULATOR' RICHARD J. SANDERSON, KATHLEEN RULON, ELLY G. GROENEBOER, anp DAVID W. TALMAGE, “From the Department of Microbiology and the Webb- Waring Lung Institute, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, ‘Denver, Colorado 80882 ‘The blastogenic and mitogenic response of murine splenic lymphocytes to concanavalin A and the response of the resulting blasts to a lymphokine co-stimulator preparation was cxamined with an electronic particle counting and sizing apparatus (Coulter Counter and Channelizer). Mitogenesis, as determined by increase in cell number, correlated well with the time-integrated uptake of tritiated thymidine. It was found that co-stim- ulator was highly mitogenic to the lectin-induced blasts, and that the cells appearing in response to it were uni- formly large (co-stimulator blasts). Furthermore, the eventual increase in cell number was proportional to the co-stimulator concentration, at least for the concentra- tions, cell numbers, and incubation times examined. This, relatively simple assay that uses the Coulter Counter and Channelizer is therefore capable of substituting for serial measurements of tritiated thymidine uptake and yields additional information on the volume spectra of responding cells, as well as forming the basis for assay- ing co-stimulator activity. ‘The co-stimulator blasts were found to be capable of killing a wide variety of allogenele as well as syngeneic concanavalin A induced blasts. The level of killing in a Sehr “'Cr release assay varied between 9% (for the syn- geneic caso) and 24% of the maximum obtained by water lysis. ‘The proliferation oflymphocytes in eeponse to concanavalin ‘A (Con A) has been shown to be mediated by the release of a |ymphokine (co-stimulator) (1). Although it has been shown to ‘be nonmitogenic to resting lymphocytes (1), we wil show here that co-timulator causes a strong proliferation ina cell popt- lation previously stimulated by Con A, and that this prolifer- ating population contains cytotoxic cells. Its now that when spleen oF lymph node cells are mixed with allogeneic tumor call, membranes, or normal calls, killer cells may ar may not ‘be produced (2-10), depending presumably on the ability of the allogeneic calls to stimulate the production of co-stimalator in the responding cell population.

""This work was supported in part by National Cancer Institute Grant CA 20744 and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disoases Grant Al 02047. It seems likely then, that the proliferation of killer cells in response to elther the nonspecific stimulus of a mitogen, or to ‘the specific stimulus of an allogeneic call, requires co-stiraulator, In this paper, we have used a Coulter Counter to show the change in volume spectra and numbers of spleen or lymph node cells present in a response to Con A, and in the numbers of large cells that follow a subsequent addition of co-stimulator. Results have been correlated with tritiated thymidine uptake. It is shown that the most substantial cell proliferation is in response to co-stimulator, and is limited to the large cells in the volume spectrum. Furthermore, it appears that these large cells, which we term “co-stimulator blasts,” include populations, ‘that ae capable of rapid killing ofboth allogeneic and syngeneic “Con A blasts.” MATERIALS AND METHODS Mice.

Gross* Columbia University. School of Public Heath. 600 West 168 Street, New York, NY 10032 and ‘Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC 29425. U.S.A, Received in reised form 29 August 1990) Abstract—Meta-analysis, a set of statistical tools for combining and integrating the results of independent studies of a given scientific issue, can be useful when the stringent conditions under which such integration is valid are met. In this report we point out the dificuties in obtaining sound meta-analyses of either controlled clinical trials or epidemiological studies. We demonstrate that hastily or improperly designed meta- ‘analyses can lead to results that may not be scientifically valid. We note that much care is typically taken when meta-analysis is applied to the results of clinileal trials. The Food and Drug Administration, for example, requires strict adherence to the principles we discuss in this paper before it allows a drug's sponsor to use a meta-analysis of separate clinical studies in support of a New Drug Application. ‘Such care does not always carry over to epidemiological studies, as demonstrated by the 1986 report of the National Research Council concerning the purported association between exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and the risk of tung cancer. On the basis of a meta-analysis of 13 studies, 10 of which were retrospective and the remaining 3 prospective in nature, the Council concluded that non-smokers who are exposed to fenviconmental tobacco smoke are at greater risk of acquiring lung cancer than rhon-smokers not so exposed. In our opinion. this conclusion in unwarranted given the poor quality of the studies on which itis based, 1, INTRODUCTION yes.” The criteria for reaching this affirmative answer are now considered. In applications of meta-analysis to clinical trials, the following questions, among many other that must be addressed, arise. ‘A working definition of meta-analysis is given by Huque [I]: “...the term “meta-analysis! refers to a statistical analysis which combines or integrates the results of several independent inical trials, considered by the analyst to be ‘combinable’.” As indicated by this characteriz~ @ Are all studies to be included in the meta- analysis. or only the published ones? ation of meta-analysis, its key application is to be found in the analysis and synthesis of data from clinical trials. The question then remains, can meta-analytic techniques be applied in the analysis of other kinds of data such as those that arise in cohort and case-control studies found in epidemiol- ogy? The answer to this question is a guarded crue ut ‘ Are all published studies to be included in the meta-analysis, or only the “good” ones? & ‘When the studies’ results are hetero-> geneous, how may they be included in a meta-analysis, or should they be meta-ana-£> lyzed at all?

Senator Earle Clements The Tobacco Institute, Inc. 1776 K Street, Northwest Nashington, D.C. 20006 Dear Senator Clements At Mr. Galloway's suggestion, I have written each chief executive of five tobacco companies of our intent to develop a program on tobacco research of major significance at Harvard. T enclose that correspondence for your interests. The size of the program, and its eventual success and productivity, will depend most directly on the magnitude of support provided by the tobacco industry. I want to see as good and as large a program as we can develop at Harvard, and I want to see it functional just as soon as possible. As I have stated many times now, I also want the tobacco industry to be deeply involved, on a collaborative basis, in our research. It is very difficult for us to work administratively with so many representatives from the various tobacco companies. The one person who has stood head and shoulders above the rest in providing administrative leadership and guidance, from the standpoint of the tobacco industry, is Jack Roemer of R.J. Reynolds Industries. It was Mr. Roemer who convinced me that I had a responsibility to help solve the tobacco controversy and I can assure you that without his help I would never have becone involved in a major way. Mr. Roemer also has the ideal image and character to work with the academic leaders at Harvard. Although he is with Reynolds, it is of crucial importance to us that he be able to act as a spokesman for the entire industry relative to our developing a program here. I hope that you, with your wisdom and diplomacy, can help implement that. If there is anything more I can do at this time, please let me know.

These rates have decelerated greatly during the ‘most recent 5:year period, 1984-1986 to 1989-1991.

Because cigarette “tar"" contains numerous eareinegens, it is plausible that the secular changes in lung eancer rates are the fonsequences of changes in the formulation and manu: facture of tobacco products in resent decades. Previous fease-contro] and cobort studies found the risk of hung ‘cancer for smoking lower “tar” cigarettes to be signi: ‘cantly lower than for emoking high-""tas” cigarettes (2). ‘However, this conclusion was based on studies of sok fers of cigarettes that contained much higher “tar” lev- ‘ls than those commonly smoked during recent de- cades (9). ""The extent of cancer risks associated with smoking the newer, lower “ta:” cigarettes have not been estab- lished because these cigarettes were only recently in- troduced into the mare, whereas lang cancer has a latency period measurable in decades.
