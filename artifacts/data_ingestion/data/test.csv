to extracellular and intracellular stimli © maintain homeostasis and hypoxia is one of the ‘most fundamental of all environmental stimuli a major physiologic mechanism by which mammals respond to tissue hypoxia is through stimulation of erythropoiesis resulting in fan increased blood oycarrying capacity erythropoietin epo the primary humoral regulator of mammalian eryth topoiesis epo rna levels increase several hundredfold in ‘rodent liver and kidney in response to hypoxia or anemia for review see refs 1 and 2 human epo rna levels show ‘similar increases in transgenic mouse liver and kidney 36 hypoxia also induces epo rna transcription in hep3b ‘human hepatoblastoma cells 7 demonstrating thatthe same cell type can sense hypoxia and respond by increasing epo rna levels the production of epo and subsequent increase in erythropoiesis thus provide a major homeostatic mecha nism for maintaining issue oxygenation ‘a major research objective in our laboratory has been to identify the cisacting dna sequences and transacting pro tein factors that regulate hypoxiainducible human epo gene expression liverspecific dnase hypersensitive sites have been identified in the

treatment of hep3b cells with cycloheximide inhibited the hypoxic induc tion of both epo rna 7 and hif1 dna binding acuvity 9 these results provided further evidence for the impor ance of hif1 in epo gene transcriptional activation by hypoxia and suggested that induction of hif1 activity ‘quires de novo protein synthesis ‘a growing number of other mammalian genes have been feported whose expression is induced by hypoxia 1115 ‘the molecular basis for induction has not been established for any of these genes although induction of vascular endo thelial growth factor rna is inhibited by cycloheximide 14 to determine whether hif1 plays a general role in the hypoxic activation of gene transcription we have analyzed ‘mammalian cell ines in which the epo gene is nat expressed hif1 was

respectively both agents also produced sensitization in an 11fold ddpre sistant 2008 subline neither bombesin nor tnfa changed the accumulation of ddp glutathione content or glutathiones transferase activity in 2008 cells however a 2h exposure to ‘oth bombesin and tnfa was suficent to increase 2008 clon ing efficiency by up to 2601 sdfold and 22201 sd fold and it increased average colony size by 135201 sd fold and 15501 sdfol respectively bombesin increased intracellular free calcium and this was blocked by the bombe sin receptorspecific antagonist sc196 demonstrating that 2008 cells have functional bombesin receptors these results indicate that bombesin and tnfa can enhance sensitivity to ddp in both ddp sensitive and resistant variants of a human ‘ovarian carcinoma and that both

february 16 2000 mr brad timbes chevron in response to the questions relayed to us by our sales department id like to give you more information about camels new “pleasure to burn” advertising campaign ‘the “pleasure to burn” campaign is a wellrounded campaign that accurately depicts “the old and new” by mixing contemporary and classic with alittle bit of fun it celebrates the heritage of the camel brand yet is relevant to today its also an excellent display for retail given its vibrant colors and simple visuals ‘the “pleasure to bum” ads capitalize on the fact that camel holds a unique position as a cigarette brand which has a rich heritage but also keeps up with the times the campaign celebrates the decades of camels popularity  reflecting different cultural periods and tastes in our society — but also brings the ads up to date by juxtaposing elements of past eras and contemporary cues at first glimpse the ads appear to have a retro feel but a second look reveals utterly modern elements for example a male detective wears a classic hat and trench coat but sports an earring and a lady reminiscent of past eras chats on a cell phone the ads are designed to stand out and deliver a telegraphic and impactful message it offers us a highly branded format but in a classic painting style that feels more like art than advertising the format is designed to translate easily and impactfully to many different media and applications — a variety of sizes shapes formats and locations for example the graphics would work in a magazine ad a bar sign a directmail piece or in retail display it is important to us in developing advertising that we not only clearly communicate the brands message in a distinctive way but we emphasize being sensitive to how consumers might perceive the ad all of our advertising concepts are presented to an in house “advertising review panel” to get reactions from average employees who work in various departments outside our sales and marketing areas and tested with consumer focus groups consumer testing showed that the “pleasure to burn” ads had very broad appeal among adult smokers of all ages and both genders in focus groups among male and female adult smokers ranging in age from 21 to fifties the “pleasure to burn” ads got an overwhelmingly positive response from both males and females they described the ads as “fun” “upbeat” nostalgic yet contemporary  the elements that capture camels personality and image an article in the new york times september 22 described the “pleasure to burn” ads as “a playful commemoration of the camel brand’s history” enclosed are samples of some ads from the “pleasure to burn” campaign rjr0000001241009542 70059 8335 e20l 19les,2

february 10 1993 apstract we have used a combination of physical and motecular biological techniques to examine the structure of leptomonas collosoma spliced leader rna we confirm the general features of the previously proposed structure for the 3’ half of the rna in which a singlestranded region is flanked by two stem loops however we find that the 5’ half of the rna which contains the spice site has two competing secondary structures which differ only slightly in stability and which can interconvert on a fast 1 s time scale in the favored conformation a stable hairpin helix is augmented by conserved complementarity between the splice site and the s’end ofthe sl rna this putative helix has anomalous nuclease sensitivity and thermal stability features suggesting that itis probably coupled by unknown tert other nucleotides in the 5 halfmolecule the structure offers intriguing parallels with rnarna 5301 interactions in the mammalian splicing system premrna splicing sa processby which

 ‘thomas 1988 ‘the proposed secondary structure for the kinetoplastid spliced leader sl rnas bruzik et al 1988 was based upon relative free energies predicted by the fold program zuker 1989 and upon conservation ofthe folding pattern for several sl rnas this structural conservation among the trypanosomatid sl rnas is striking due tothe lack of length and sequence homology ouside ofthe spliced leader exon portion of the molecule the proposed secondary structure contains three stem loops the second and third of which flank a singlestranded region which has the sequence ofa binding ste for sm

features of the proposed model bruzik et al 1988 primarily by determining the stability and binding kinetics of dna oligonucleotides hybridized to the putatively singlestranded regions which ae predicted by the model this approach yielded the predicted results for the 3 but not the 5’ half of the molecule we also examined the thermal unfolding equilibria and kinetics for the molecule ‘using the temperaturejump tjump technique in which ‘thesampleis rapidly heated and the optical changeis measured asa function of time we found a lowtemperature thermal transition which could not be accounted for by unfolding of ihelies in the model of bruzik et al 1988 subsequent experiments localized this effect to the 5’half of the molecule we then employed mutagenesis and polyacrylamide gel

probe the structure ofthe s‘halfof leptomonascollosomaslrna we propose anew structure in which a stable hairpin helix is augumented by pairing of the 5’ end of the sl rna with the spice site ‘the hairpin helix has a measured ty about 6 °c higher than the analogous helix proposed by broziketal 1988 however the putative splice site helix bas unusual properties including ‘anomalously small thermal stability changes upon mutation singlestrand nuclease sensitivity a the splicesiteand apparent tertiary interactions with additional nucteotides in the 5 half of the slrna we speculate that

a10 no 87 despite his preference for bilateral negotiations yeutter said that the japanese would have to give in on beef and citrus if both countries were to return to the table “tt takes two to tango and the japanese negotiators were not tangoing” 1e said “i was getting tired of negotiating with myself” japanese offer ‘the trade representative explained that sato had offered to remove javanese quotas on beef over three years increasing the quota levels—to let in more goods—by 10 perceni annually and then eliminating them entirely in the fifth year for citrus the japa nese had offered to remove quotas after five years ‘yeutter explained tat the united states would have been willing to accep the threeyear removal of beef quotas but that the japanese had also wanted to impose a type of import surcharge on us beef in exchange for the tariff removal yeutter said he could not accept this offer because although the quotas would be removed the price constraints “could be just as onerous” as what was originally in place he said with regard to citras yeutter said that he was not willing to accept a fveyear tariff removal without compensation for the us citrus industry “what we had offered was two years with anything over that including a patience payment” which he explained is a compensatory payinent agreed to prior to a gatt ruling “we felt that live years was far too long” he added at the press confcrence agriculture department officials circulated a statement from agriculture sec retary richard lyng who is currently in fallbrook calif in the statement lyng said that he was “extemely disappointd” that an agreement had not been reached and tiat he had supported yeutters efforts toward a resolution  advertising health officials urge congress to restrict cigarette advertising charge deception representatives of “public health groups may 4 urged a house subconnittee to push ahead with pro posed legislation hr 1532 hr 3294 to restrict or ban cigarette advertising charging that ads for lowtar and lownicotine produets are deceptive  ‘tobacco companies ‘are consciously deceiving the public by using their advertising to lull smokers into believing that socalle4 “light” cigarettes— those con taining lower levels of tar and nicotine—are safeto smoke although there is no medical evidence that light cigarettes pose less uf a health hazard the public health officials charged  “consumers who piichase lowtar and lownicotine cigarettes believing that they are substantially redue ing their risk of heart disease chronic obstructive lung disease or cance are seriously mistaken” said dr alfred munzeroi the coalition on smoking or health—composed of the american heart associ regulation economics and law der 5588 ation american lung association and american can cer society—told the house energy and commerce transportation ‘tourism and hazardous materials subcommittee “advertisements which promote these cigarettes directly or indirectly as significantly safer alternatives are patently false” ° dr robert e medfee of the american medical association noted that while tobacco companies are touting the health benefits of light cigarettes in their advertising medical studies show many smokers of light cigareites end up getting about the same doses of tar and nicotine as smokers of regular cigarettes because they tend to inhale more deeply and smoke more cigarettes “there is no safe cigarette and no safe level of tobacco consumption” he said mcafee charged that advertisements for light ciga rettes are confusing if not outright deceptive for ‘example he said cigarette makers use such labelling terms as “low tar” “lower tar” “ultra low tar “lights” and “ultra’ lights” which are industry desig nations with no legal or medical meaning such terms are “misleading and are applied to many brands ‘which do not provide lower doses of tar and nicotine” he said scott d ballin vice president for public affairs for the coalition on smoking or health charged that the federal trade commission has failed to take action against deceptive low tar and nicotine advertise ments ballin said that the coalition supports hr 3294 which’ would require “that cigarette ‘advertising be regulated under food and drug administration mat keting guidelines for legal drugs  me ftc testimony consumers are better servedby an unregulated advertising environment since they are likely to bs exposed to more information that way fc chairman daniel oliver argued as long as the information on tar and nicotine content is accurate advertisements promoting light cigarettes “can be a’ valuable source of information to consumers” he said if the advertis ing is deceptive the ftc will take action against the company he added we subcommittee chairman rep thomas luken d ohio and ranking minority member bob whittaker rkan—who previously introduced hr 3294 and hr 1582 which would impose a total ban on cigarette advertising—said that they are working on another bill which would allow states torequire more strin gent health warnings than federal law ‘requires tt ‘would also permit plaintiffs to bring” suit against cigarette companies even if the companies complied with federal warnings and it would require the ftc to contract with either a government or private labora tory to conduct annual studies of tar and nicotine levels the laboratory would also collect data on the average levels of other chemicals commonly found in cigarettes including carbon monoxide ammonia cya nide formaldehyde and radioactive compounds the representatives expect to introduce the bill which is still being drafted this weekc ccopyiight © 1988 by the bureau of national affairs inc washington 06 20087 or4e31558980050 timn 0061655,9

reliability of self reporting questionnaires for determining passive exposure to cigarette smoke in office environments a white paper by david a sterling demetrios j moschandreas increased amount of publications and advocate advertising on the health effects of smoking has led to the growing concern of nonsmokers on potential effects of passive exposure to cigarette smoke to assess this potential exposure researchers have used several scientific instruments prevalent ‘among them are individual self reporting or interview questionnaires asking people how many cigarettes they smoke or nonsmokers how many cigarettes are smoked near them may seem a reasonable approach however discrepancies between estimated consumption through questionnaire surveys and actual number consumed have been reported around 30 percent » it is suspected that a large portion of the discrepancy is due to the tendency of respondents to systematically underreport benavidr or events which may be perceived as undesirable although it has not been investigated there may also be a tendency of nonsmokers to overreport their perceived exposure to cigarette smoke correction factors have been developed and used on smoking data to approximate actual rates if nonsmokers also show a systematic reporting bias t may be possible to develope another set of such correction factors there is a need for focused research to determine the reliability of using questionnaires for assessing passive exposure to cigarette smoke iitri proposes an investigation to assess the reliability of self reporting ques tionnaires specifically we will address questionnaires on smoking behavior which are typically used in indoor air quality studies for assessing possible exposure to cigarette smoke of non smokers in public environments the investigation will attempt to determine the variation around a “true number of reported cigarettes consumed by smokers and reported exposed to by nonsmokers zoesovos ut research institute 1,6

introduction ‘the neurotransmitter acetylcholine elicits rapid responses by interacting with nicotinic receptors nachrs and slower effects via muscarinic receptors machrs muscarinic responses are observed in the central and peripheral nervous system as well as in muscle and in glands and representa large proportion of the acetylcholinemediated effects due to the extraordinarily high number of nachrs found in the post synaptic membrane of the electromotor synapses of electric fish knowledge of the mechanism and structure of nachrs hhas increased tremendously in recent years changeux 1981 ‘advances in research on machrs have been much less rapid this is due to the lower concentration of macars together with the fact that these receptors have not yet been purified earlier radioligand binding studies revealed that machrs are discrete membrane components which recognize an tagonist and agonist molecules gorissen et al 1978 birdsall et al 1979 haga 1980 as is the case with many other receptor systems the two types of ligands appear to differ in their mechanisms of interaction in the following way only agonists induce receptor desensitization in intact cell prepara tions klein et

more integral membrane compartment is stimulated by ca” in vitro this event is thought to be necessary for activation of the enzyme to determine whether such a redistribution of protein kinase c occurs following hormonally stimulated increases in cytoplasmic ca we measured °hphorbol 1213dibutyrate hjpdb binding to protein kinase c in intact 1921n1 astrocy toma cells the muscarinic agonist carbachol causes a 2fold inerease in hjpdb binding this increase is transient peaking at 1 min and returning toward con trol levels by 5 min seatchard analysis of hpdb binding in the presence of carbachol reveals a 2fold increase in the bau and no change in the kp compared to control values this increase in byax likely repre sents a redistribution of protein kinase c to the mem brane because hipdb binding in intact cells is pre dominantly to membraneassociated enzyme the ca’ ionophore ionomycin and two other camobilizing hormones bradykinin and histamine mimic the effects of carbachol furthermore when hormonesensitive ca stores are depleted by prior agonist treatment the carbacholinduced increases in intracellular ca and hipdb binding are completely blocked under these conditions phosphoinositide hydrolysis and di acylglycerol dag formation are not inhibited we also examined the time course of dag accumulation in response to carbachol dag is not yet significantly elevated when the increase in hjpdb binding is max imal furthermore hjpdb binding has returned to control levels when dag concentrations are maxi mally elevated these data suggest that hormonestim ulated increases in cytoplasmic ca cause a marked and rapid redistribution of protein kinase c which recedes uny significant increase in dag our findings also demonstrate that hjpdb binding to intact cells may be a useful measure of the ability of camobiliz ing hormones to affect protein kinase c “the cat and phospholipiddependent protein kinase pr0 tein kinase c exists as a peripheral membrane protein that can

received for publieston april 23 1984 denise polacekt robert e byrne mary burrous and angelo m scanut§ from the departments of medicine and §biochemistry university of cheap pritzher schoo of medicine ‘chicago minois 60837 human highdensity lipoprotein class3 hdl was incubated with freshly isolated blood polymorphonu clear leukocytes pmn at 37 and 4 °c at both tem peratures the release of proteolytic activity pa caus ing the specific hydrolysis of apoaii was dependent on the concentration of hdl in the medium at 37°c the efflux of pa was linear and no saturation was reached up to an hdl protein concentration in the ‘medium of 800 ugml in turn at 4°c maximal pa release was reached at a concentration below 600 ug ml of hdl proteinml in the medium canine hdl ‘which contains apoai but not apoait was as effe tive as human hdl in promoting the release of pa from pmn this property was also exhibited by egg lecithineholesterol vesicles containing apoai at 4°c there was no strict correlation between efflux of pa affected by hdl and specific binding of iapo aihdl in competitive binding experiments a 50 fold excess of unlabeled hdl prevented more than 90 of the binding of iapoai hdls to pmn ‘whereas an excess of unlabeled lowdensity lipoprotein exhibited no effect when human hdl was incubated ‘with pmn at 4 or 37 °c and then subjected to ultracen trifugation at d 121 gml most of the pa that was initially associated with this lipoprotein was recovered in the bottom of the tube by gel filtration both pa and hdl were in the same peak ina low ionic strength buffer but were dissociated from each other by a high salt solution 4 121 gml we conclude that both ns urally occurring hdls and apoaistabilized lipid vesicles favor the release from pmn of an enzymatic activity which cleaves human apoaii this release appears to be dependent both on the interaction of the cells with the lipoprotein ligand and on the lipoprotein surface area acting as the acceptor for the enzyme probably through electrostatic forces early studies from this laboratory showed that when a mixed population of human blood leukocytes is incubated  this work was supported by united states

protein constituent of hdl subsequently we found that of the blood leukocytes only pmn cause the proceolysis of apoaii in hdls 2 ‘since litle is known of the function of apoai the demon stration that pmn contain a protease capable of a specific cleavage of apoaii prompted us to examine in vitro the mechanisms underlying the release of this cellular protease and the role played by hdl in this process the results of ‘these studies are the subject of this report a preliminary ‘account has appeared 3 experimental procedures results a studies with human hdl 1 dependence of protease release
