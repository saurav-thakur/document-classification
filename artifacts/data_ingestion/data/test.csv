CATELLI, W. SCHNEIDER, ano G. SHYAMALA. Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research-the Jet ‘Montreal, Quebec, Canada; and Lab Hormones, Bicétre, France ABSTRACT. Recently two lines of evidence have implicated that cellular heat shock proteins (hap) ray pay «role in steroid hormonal regulation of target tissues, One i the demonstration that cellular 90K tp (hsp-90) can complex with steroid recep tors in vitro and inhibit their ability to interact with DNA, and second, the demonstration that in wan oviduct ex steroids can ‘regulate the synthesis ofhsp-108. Aa yet, tere lao eport that sex steroids can regula hap-80 rynthesi, especialy in man malian tissves. In these studies we have exatined the estrogenic wish General Hospital, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, ‘reduces the uterine concentration of hp-90, and estradiol causes ‘time-dependent increas in uterine hap-90 as eary as 4h afer steroid edministation, reaching a maximum increase of 411d Detween 18-26 h, The effect is specific to estrogens and not lite by other steroid hormones, Its also target isu specific uch that itis seen with uterus end vagina ad does not occu in nontarget tissue for estradiol, such as pleen. The posable Dhyiological significance of estiogenic stimulation of uterine ‘hsp-90 has been discussed. (Endocrinology 123: 956-961, 1988) 1988) regulation of mutine werine hp-80, We report thet ovariectomy H™ shock proteins are a group of related proteins, which are induced in response to stress in a wide range of eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells (1, 2). The classical inducers of these proteins in eukaryotic cells are elevation in temperature (heat), heavy metals, alco- hol, and glucose starvation. The precise function of these proteins is not known, but overall they are thought to be intimately involved in maintaining tissue homeostasis, Recently, one of the stress proteins, the 90K heat shock protein (hsp-90) has received considerable attention with regard to its possible role in regulating steroid hormone action in target tissues. A cellular hsp-90 has been shown to be associated with a variety of molybdate-stabilized nonactivated steroid-receptor complexes (3, 4), and this association has been found to be responsible for main- taining the receptor in a state unable to interact with DNA in vitro (65, 6). It has also been speculated that hsp- ‘90 may satisfy the criteria for the in vivo cellular protein, responsible for masking the DNA-binding site of the receptor in the absence of steroid (5-8), In addition to the documentation that hsp-90 can complex with steroid receptors in vitro there are two reports which reveal that steroid hormones can regulate the synthesis of hsp.

Davis Jewish General ‘Hospital, 3755 Cote Ste-Catherine Road, Montreal, Quebec, Canada Hot 12. {This work was supported by a grant from the NCI of Caned (to Gs). 956 the chicken oviduct hsp-108 has been shown to be under transcriptional regulation by estrogen and progesterone (9). Similarly, in L929 cells dexamethasone has been shown to augment the synthesis of hsp-90 (10). ‘These observations suggest the possibility that in target tissues for steroids, steroid hormones and cellular hsp-90 may ‘mutually regulate their cellular functions. For the last 2 decades the rodent uterus has been used Widely as a model system for delineating the mechanisin of estrogen action and estrogen receptors in mammalian cells. Therefore, it seemed plausible to us that an exam. ination of the potential relationship between estrogen action and cellular hsp-90 in mouse uterine tissue may Provide us with certain insights concerning the possible cellular function of hsp-90. Accordingly, we have exam- ined the steroid hormonal regulation of hsp-90 in mouse uterus and report that estradiol increases the level of this protein in a steroid- and tissue-specific manner.

Excessive smoking is ‘one ‘of the causative factors Jn tung cancer.” © Medical Research Coun- cil of Great Britai lung cancer is asso ith’ tobacco smoking, ed particularly in the form of Cigarets. In the opinion of the council, the most reason- able interpretation of this evidence is that the relation- ship is one of direct cause and effect © Health Council of Hol- Jand:: “,.. There are 0 counter arguments against the assumption of such a re- lationship ""(smoking causes ung cancer)... If the above mentioned increase continues, the frequency of Jung cancer in the following generation will be alarming- Ty great.” © Research Council of Sweden: "". . . substance in tobacco smote constitute... essential factor in the occur= rence in certain types of Jung cancer.” DAViES came to Memphis, in 1966 from the faculty of Columbia University Medi- cal Center, New York. He served as executive director of the American Cancer So- ciety for five yearsand pub- lished a report six years be- fore the 1854 U.S, Surge Sent to Ad Hoc & Staff General's report, reaching the same conclusions — namely, that smoking causes ung cancer and 2 host of other respiratory diseases. Dr. Carr, clinical professor of ‘thoracic surgery and founder of the Thoracic Sur- gery Association, told. the House Commerce Committee that assuming for argu- ‘ment's sake that only cigaret smokers developed lung can- cer, that with about 70 mil- lion smokers in the nation, there would only be one death per 1,400 smokers. Dr. Davies said this argu- ment was “fallacious” be- ‘cause smoking causes so ‘many other diseases that kill lung. cancer victims betore the” cancer progresses to @ fatal state. Davies said there are twice as many people who die of ‘heart attacks each year than with lung cancer. QUOTING a US. Public Health study published last year, Dr. Davies seid cigae et ‘smoking increases the likelihood of death by coro- nary disease by about 70 per ccent. For persons suffering from high blood pressure, 5-26-69 the risk jumps to 200 per cent if they smoke, Davies said, From the same’ report, Davies said over a quarter of a. million premature deaths occur each year from diseases associated with aret smoking and that there are 11 million extra cases of ‘chronic disease in cigaret smoking populations compared ""to non-smoking populations. -. Davies said the com- mittee Dr. Carr testified be- fore is considering legisla tion to ban cigaret commer cials on television “The — smoking-causes- lung-cancer controversy end- ed ‘long ago,” Dr. Davies sald. “The issue today is hhow to break the chain of children copying adults who are hooked on cigarets.” He added: “One wonders about the topsy-turvy society which spends money throvgh government expenditures to prevent food poisoning, but ‘then turns right around and spends millions of dollars throwgh advertising for ar industty which manipulate the citizen’ and” p him to an early death, LEPSZTIO O",9

"Corner on Research The Health Realization Approach to Resiliency By BONNIE BENARD Far West Laboratory for Educational RED In his chronicle of the lives of people struggling during the Great Depression, Let Us Now Praise Fa- rus Men, james Agee wrote: ""In every child who is born, under no matter what circumstances, and no matter what parents, the potentiality of the human race is born again.” No words better summarize the belief system inherent in the resiliency paradigm. It is a belief system that manifests itself in the follow- ing words to a child or youth: “You can be who you ‘want to be; you can achieve your dream: I believe in, 7°. Tpese words communicate that powerful protec: tive factor, high expectations, which the child then internalizes as self-efficacy. The result is not only motivation but a sense of purpose and bright fu- ture—enother attsbute of the resilient person. How- ‘ever, many youth hear the opposite message in their famlies, schools, or communities: “You're not good enough: your family’s ‘at risk’; your sex, race, cul- ture, or ethnicity are not good enough: you'll never amount to anything,” These negative words create interralized thoughts of impotence, such as: “I'm ‘not good enough there’s no reason to try; things will never change’”—words reflecting not only loss of motivation but loss of Unforuinately, the number of youth growing up ‘with no sense of a bright future is increasing at an. alarming rate. As one journalist states: “Youthful ‘America’s vision of its own future has never been more dire, particularly in the cities, As one 17-year- old African American put it on his way into court ‘T been dead since Iwas 12, s0 I'm not afraid of dying, T'm just waiting to get kicked into the grave’ ” (Vo gel, 1994). I'd lke to share with you an approach that has demonstrated effectiveness at facilitating the devel- opment within youths or adults of the belief that they are innately resilient—that they have the cape ity to develop caring relationships, to solve their ‘own problems, to feel good about who they are, and tobe optimistic about their future. While I've writ- ten previously about the Health Realization model developed by Roger Mills (see Benard and Lorio, 1991; Linquant, 1992), Tam continually impressed by the growing number of practitioners—in the From Wester Center News, December 1994, Vol.8, No. 1 fields of addiction, education, community organiza- tion, community policing, organizational develop- ment, therapy, and counseling —using this approach across the country in schools, community-based 0 {gonizations, housing projects, treatment centers, hes- Pitals, businesses, and communitywide collabora- ions. I'd like to discuss Health Realization as applied resiliency, that is, how this approach integrates and iMustrates our resiliency model, which is grounded in developing environments rich inthe protective factors of caring, high expectations, and opporturi- ties for participation in order to foster the individual traits of resilience: social competence, problem-solv- ing, autonomy, and sense of Bright future. Finally, ‘welll discuss what the Health Realization approach offers the field of prevention and early intervention. ‘The Health Realization approach evolved from the application of the principles of a new wellness paradigm in psychology, Psychology of Mind, to the prevention, early intervention, and community de- ‘velopment arenas. Health Realization began in the late 1980s with a demonstration project in a Dade County, Florida, housing project beset with the ef- fects of poverty and racism: violence, drug-dealing, domestic violence, teen 7 and school fail- ure. Today, Health Realization is demonstrating its effectiveness not only in dramatically reducing the rates ofall these problems but also in building a serise of community pride and well-being in commu- nities across the nation. Some of the findings from pre-and juations of the 142 families and 604 ‘youth involved in the three-year Dade County pro- ject include significantly improved parent-child rela- tionships in 87 percent of the families, a75 percent reduction in delinquency and school-related prob- Jem behaviors, a 65 percent decrease in drug traffick- ing, an 80 percent decrease in teen pregnancy, and a 60 percent decrease in substance abuse. Recent find- ings from the one-and-a-half year Coliseum Gardens Project in Oakland, California, include a cessation of all gang warfare and ethnic clashes between the ‘Cambodian and African American youth, 45 per- cent reduction in violent crimes (and no homicides since the project began), and a 110 percent increase in youth involvement in the Boys and Girls Club.

This description is for your review and can be modified at the groups discretion. ‘As our first item of business we need to look at lnb chemical disposal at BGTC. The intent of ths effort is to minimize the amount of lab chemicals that are sent to the stock room for commercial disposal. Commercial disposal is expensive and should be utilize only when there is not a more cost effective option available. Disposal options must be safe and comply with environmental regulations. Reduction can be achieved if lab personne! are better informed on the disposal options that are available for managing waste chemicals. T have attached a document (LAB CHEMICAL WASTE DISPOSAL GUIDELINES) for your review. The group needs to determine if these guidelines are workable and make changes as necessary. The approved guidelines can then be referred to the Rules and Procedures Subcommittee who will be responsible for implementation. ‘We will meet monthly and members should try to send someone to represent their area when they can not attend. etze Tetzs",0

"lation of the entire United States, reports that only 14 per cent of regular elgarctte smokers state that they consider the habje pleasurable, safe, and worth the cost, Why do smokers not give up the habit that so many-state they would like (o shed? Despite pronouncements from health authorities in all parts of the world, the proportion of smokers reporting suceessful discontinuation of smoking is from 10 to 20 per cent in mates and 3 to 10 per cent in femates (Hacnszel et al. 1956, P. 24; Hammond & Perey 1958, p. 2,956; Cart wright et al, 1959, p. 726; and Horn 1963, p. 391). Immediately following the 1964 report of the surgeon general of the United States, 8.6 per cent of the smoking students at two U.S. colleges xe- ported that they stopped smoking as a result of the health hazard identified in this report (Katahn et al. 1964). Again, a greater percentage of male smokers (10.3 per cent) than female smokers (5.9 Per cent) reported quitting. In addition, more nat- ural science majors (18.2 per cent) quit smoking than did liberal arts majors (6.7 per cent). The same students took a story-compietion test requi ing them to create both an imaginary story and an estimate of the amount of time which in reality would have transpired during the occurrence of the sequence of events in the story. Ex-smokers tended to respond with a longer time perspective than did students who continued to smoke, and the authors suggest that these individuals might be more likely {0 worry about long-term health hazards, Immediately before and following the surgeon general's report, several researchers atiempted to find effective means for discourag-ng initiation and encouraging cessation of the smoking habit. Horn (1960) used a variety of educa:ional approaches. with high school students in Pordand, Oregon, but he reported oxty minimal success ‘i: preventing the {initiation of smoking. Both Horn (1664, personal ‘communication ) and Lawden (1965. personal com- munleation) have attempted to help adult smokers discontinue smoking through the use of weekly educational meetings (Horn fn Washington) and weekly “group therapy” sessions (Lawton in Phil- adelphia). With both techniques, success rates were not much higher than the 10 to 20 per cent “spontaneous” successes reported by other writers. The Horn and Lawton studies raise an important question for all cessation studies: who is an ex- smoker? Is he an individual who quits for a week, a month, a year, oF fotever? It fs both a common observation and an established statistical fact that SMOKING 339 many ex-smokers resume the habit after varying, 1. After reviewing, the above liter: the present withors have concluded that, in all probability, people begin t» smoke for essentially the same reasons that they adopt other habits. such as eating certain foods, using certain brands of soap. wearing lipstick, joing to sec the Beatles, and so forth, That is, initiation of smoking appesrs to be a result of the millions of dottars spent yearly by (cigarette) manufacturers to influence people 0 do 80; the standards and fads extant in youthful and adult social circles; the examples provided by parents and families; the depth of cormmitment to. personal religious codes; and, finally, some paycho- logical and personality characteristics (e.g., extra- version, tension, neuroticism, etc.) of the indi- Vidual himself, In our opinion, the last category (personality characteristics) is the least influential in determining whether a given individual will hegin to smoke, whereas the other factors Cespectally the amount spent on world-wide advertising) have con- sideri-s» influence. Once started, however, contin- ‘uation or discontinuation appears to be, in large part, a function of the sociopsychological charac. teristics of the individual. Joszpn D. MATARAzz0 AND RUTH G.

MALKUS *, P, BUSCHBAUM and A. CASTRO Depertment of Pethology, University of Miami, Miami, Florida 93182 (US.A.) (Received April 6th, 1978) Summary ‘A turbidimetric rate method for the determination of immunoglobulins IgG, IgA, and IgM has been adapted to an automatic kinetic rate analyzer. The pro- cedure can be run on mildly lipemic sera without correction for sample light scatter. We report correlations with results by an immunodiffusion method and a manual laser nephelometric technique. The automated rate procedure C described provides a rapid, accurate, precise and sensitive way to measure immunoglobulins. immunogen Introduction During the past few years there has been considerable clinical interest in developing convenient automated analyses for specific immunoglobulins [1,2]. Although the precipitin reaction was first identified by Krauss in 1897 [3] and ‘the manual nephelometzic quantitative analysis of specific proteins was described by Libby in 1938 [4,5], it has been the recent commercial availability of high quality monospecific antiserum that has led to the development of automated nephelometrie and turbidimetric analyses. The automated equilib- rium techniques developed on continuous flow instrumentation [6,7] and cen- trifugal analyzers [8,9] all require sample blanks due to nonspecific light scat- ter. In an‘attempt to correct for sample induced light scatter a reaction rate analyzer was adapted using an early post mixing reading [10]. A rate method of detecting antibody immunoglobulin complexes was developed on a centri- fugal analyzer modified with a laser for light scatter measurements (11—14]. ‘We have adapted the rate technique which offers the advantage of automatic blank correction to the Perkin Elmer KA-150 kinetic analyzer. The method described here gives excellent sensitivity and a large working range for immuno- gobylins IgG, IgA and IgM. ‘whom correspondence should be addresied.",6
"“What's Your Cancer Profile? [Smoking Does Not Necessarily Lead to Lung Cancer]"" Washington Post-Health (09/19/95) P. 12; Weiss, Rick Despite the claim that lung cancer is directly linked to smoking, about one in seven people diagnosed with the disease are nonsmokers. Although cigarettes are currently the single most preventable cause of cancer, 85% of smokers never contract lung cancer. Researchers say this may be because while one person may be especially sensitive to one carcinogen, he or she may be resistant to another, depending on the particular combination of genes the person inherited. Most carcinogens are usually benign when they are first Inhaled, swallowed, or absorbed through the skin. It is only when they come in contact with various activating enzymes in the body that the carcinogens become threatening, since some of the body's ordinary compounds can have an untoward effect on carcinogens and make them chemically unstable and electrically charged. Studies in molecular epidemiology have determined that cancer is the result of a complex interaction between gene makeup and environmental factors. ""Study: Food as a Cancer Preventive Drug [May Lower Chances of Lung Cancer}"" Washington Post--Health (09/19/95) P. 15 Scientists have found that people with an increased risk of cancer due to a lack of certain enzymes that neutralize carcinogens may benefit from foods that supply those enzymes or increase the production of those enzymes in the body. In performed on rats exposed to a cigarette carcinogen, a dose of the PEITC enzyme) an inhibitor found in watercress, caused a 50% reduction in lung tumors, according to ‘American Health Foundation director of research Stephen Hecht. Hecht said he and his researchers believe that a pill containing these types of inhibitor substances might be a way to reduce lung cancer in smokers who are addicted to cigarettes, but stressed that the best thing for people to do is to quit smoking. wa, fay Le ye pert f2tee60soz",9

CORP wy Behavior Genetics, Vol. 25, No. 2, 1995 The Psychopharmacological Basis of Nicotine’s Differential Effects on Behavio Individual Subject Variability in the Rat John A. Rosecrans' w a gegen HN et rer wile fa ‘COPYRIGHT HOLDER Ee ee ea Scoot ‘Nicotine, the presumed active pharmacological agent in tobacco, produces variable effects fon behavior that are at best described as “‘paradoxical""” in nature, Thus, nicotine, via tobacco use in humans or nicotine administration in experimental animals, tends to trans- pose behavior depending on predrug baseline rates of behavior. High rates of behavior appear to be reduced, while low rates of behavior appear to be increased by nicotine. This work further proposes that nicotine’s variable effects on behavior may be related to its capacity to act as a behavioral agonist and/or antagonist via its ability either to activate or to desensitize distinct central nicotinic acetyleholinergic receptors (nACHR's). ‘Nicotine is portrayed as a neuronal modulating agent that can affect behavior contingent uupon the genetic makeup of the individual subject being studied. Depending on the structure, function, and location of distinct mAChR’s, nicotine appears to be able to induce 1 wide range of behavioral effects important to the tobacco user. However, this does not rule out the role the importance that other biogenic amine systems (j.e., serotonin or dopamine) may have in the genetics of tobacco use or nicotine’s variable effects on behavior. KEY WORDS: Nicotine; smoking; nicotinic receptors; behavior, desensitization; serotonin; ine dividual variabily. INTRODUCTION The use of nicotine via its presence in tobacco has been both engaging and enigmatic to many re- searchers over the last 30 years. Its behavioral ef- fects in man appear to be “paradoxical” in nature (Robinson and Pritchard, 1992), i.e., some individ- uals appear to be aroused by nicotine (via smoking) while others are sedated following similar dosing patterns. Tobacco use has also had an important societal funetion in Native American and West In- dian cultures and has served man well in times of crisis (Klein, 1993). As pointed out by Klein, “‘General Pershing once wrote that they (cigarettes) ""Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Virginia Com- ‘monwealth University, Richmond, Virginis 23298-0615, 187 were as vital to his troops as food.”” Even Shamans in South America have employed tobacco use for centuries as a means of warding off the evil spirits * believed to cause disease in these tribal societies (Wilbert, 1987). Thus, nicotine has a rich phar- macological history of use in man, at least via the use of tobacco. Nicotine’s “paradoxical” nature has also been observed at the molecular level in studies evaluat- ing its effects at the nicotinic acetylcholinergic re- ‘ceptor (nACHR’s). Marks ef al. (1985), for exam- ple, were the first to note that chronic nicotine administration was capable of inducing an up-reg- ulation (increase in the number of receptors) of central nACBR’s. The molecular mechanism of, RACHR up-regulation appears to be related to ni- POSEETISOS",6

He was introduced by Mike McGinnis, senior consultant at the Robert Woods Johnson Foundation and a resident scholar at NRC. ‘According to Pertschuck, there are four possible scenarios regarding the settlement: 41. Worst Case: Congress starts with the weakest bill and the tobacco industry errodes it 2. Limited Possibility: intial hearings begin to address the issue. Any of the several grand juries could come back with an indictment of fraud or coruption ‘against the tobacco industry. This could make public opinion and media coverage even more biased against the industry, forcing Congress fo take more severe action. 3. More Likely: Congress splits the difference in the existing bills, creating a compromise bil 4, Possible: Nothing happens due to conflicts between Republicans and Democrats. ‘According to Pertschuck, i the activist groups want success, they should emulate the tactics of the 1960s and 1970s auto safety issue; gain the media advantage and move public opinion, which in turn, moves Congress. Pertschuck also discussed fear of a black market as a result of raising cigarette prices. He also said that damage to the tobacco industry will ocour ifthe papers being turned over uncover fraud and corruption, This will result in a public outcry that would encourage a severe deal He stressed that a broad public outcry is he mast important strategy aginst the tobacco Indust.

Because chain reactions amplify the consequences of the initiating event, in proportion to the average chain length, Viv) en: hhances the rate of oxidation of NAD(P)H in any system generating O;. This, rather than Vivy-dependent NAD(P)H oxidases, is the basie of the frequently reported Vyyratimulated oxidation of NAD(P)H by bivloxical membranes. ‘Since GSSG reductase, lipoyl dehydrogenase, and fer. redoxin:NADP” oxidoreductase can generate O; (4) it follows that they. like all other sources of O; (5-14), should exhibit a Viv, stimulation of NAD(P)H oxidation, Shi and Dalal (18, 16) have recently affirmed this expec: tation; however, they somehow failed to observe inhibition of NADPH oxidation by SOD and concluded that these flavoenzymes were acting as NADPH:Viy) oxidoreduc: teren. They further claimed that Vay accumulated in aerobic phosphate: buffered solutions. Since Vay, rapidly ‘autoxidizes under these conditions producing Oy (11-14, 17), this too represents @ contradiction of a substantial body of work Carefal reexamination of the Viv) stimulation of NADIP)H by GSSG reductase seemed to be in order. We now describe experiments which indicate that GSSG re ductase does release O,, in agreement with Massey et al.

The assessments included (1) an in vitro procedure to determine the ability of the materials to penetrate human skin, (2) 21-day dermal limit test in rabbits to determine potential systemic toxicities, and (3) a screening procedure to evaluate the chemicals’ potentials to induce developmental toxicity. In the in vitro dermal absorption procedure, the three test materials crossed human epidermis at ‘molar rates 170-330 times more slowly than the lower molecular weight homolog ethylene glycol ‘methyl ether (EM), a chemical known to induce systemic eects folowing skin application. In the 21-day dermal study, daily applications of 1000 mg/kg TM, TE, or TB did not produce systemic toxicity in male or female rabbits, including hematologic or testicular effects. The low dermal penetration rate of the triethylene glycol ethers may have played a role inthis outcome. In the developmental toxicity screening test, oral doses of 1000 mg/kg given on Days 6-15 of gestation did not produce maternal toxicity in rats and had no effect on viability or growth of offspring, pre- or postnatally, indicating low developmental toxic potential for these compounds. The resulls ofthese studies indicate that triethylene glycol methyl, ethyl, and butyl ethers have very low capacities tobe absorbed through the skin of exposed individuals, low potentials to produce systemic toxicity following oral or dermal exposures, and do not appear to be selectively toxic to the developing conceptus. The data clearly indicate that triethylene glycol ethers do not exhibit toxicologic profiles comparable to those ofthe methyl and ethyl ethers of ethylene glycol.

While certain con ponents of the immune system are depressed, others are enhanced. In particular, fn increased proportion of T lymphocytes which bear Fe receptors for IgG has, been noted in older individuals (3, 4). Natural killer (NK) cells, which are Fe receptor positive lymphocytes, are believed to play a role in immunosurveillance: viral infection, and hemopoietic regulation (S, 6). In view of the higher incidence of tumors in aged humans, attempts have been made to evaluate any possible correlation between the basal NK activity and age. Also, a central question among previous (7~10) and present investigators is whether # relationship exists between human survival and the NK component of the immune system and. if so, could NK activity be a determinant for longevity?

But some health advocates say West Virginia should have turned the money down, because it comes from tobacco companies and because the deal was brokered by a tobacco warehouse in Wéod County. The program, announced by Gov. Cecil Underwood and state schools Superintendent Henry Marockie, will provide $4.5 million over three years for the Life Skills Training program, West Virginia is the first state to implement the program statewide. Next year, more than 21,000 sixth-graders across the state will have 15 sessions under the program, urging them not to use tobacco, alcohol and other drugs. They will have 10 sessions as seventh-graders and five as eighth-graders. We need new options to prevent young people from falling into the grip of addiction to tobacco and other controlled substances,"" Underwood said during a press conference at Kanawha City Elementary School. ‘The two companies providing the $4.5 million, Philip Morris and Brown & Williamson, are two of the four tobacco companies who agreed last year to settle lawsuits by 46 states, The tobacco industry will pay the states more than $200 billion over 25 years, Marockie saluted the two businessmen who hooked the state up with the tobacco companies: Jack Bemheimer, president of Goldsmith-Black Co., and John Plesich, a consultant for the company. Goldsmith-Black is a grocery and tobacco warehouse in Wood County. In 1995, the company sued to prevent its local health department from enforcing a ban on smoking in indoor public places. A circuit judge threw the lawsuit out. ""This is the tobacco companies’ attempt to find legitimacy with adults,"" said Sara Crickenberger, executive director of the American Lung Association of West Virginia. ""This is selling our state's name to give the tobacco industry a good name. as",9

The lungs eated with papain showed varying degrees of emphysema asoriated with fan increase of lung compliance. However, the airway resist- lance during natural deflation was unaffected, The maximal flow for a given hung volume was invereely related to the lung compliance, and was comparable to the maximal flow in fhormal lungs obtained at a lower lung volume with compa- rable tung recoil force, The moderate flow limitation in the ‘emphysematous lungs was considered largely a result of the seduced lung recoil force.

Unlike human emphysema, ‘where coexining chronic bronchitis is common, the air- ‘ways in these animals were normal except for dilatation of terminal bronchioli. Thus, this experimental prepara- tion enabled us to study the effect of emphysema, un- complicated by chronic bronchitis, on the flow-pressure- volume characteristics. MATARIALS AND ocrHoDs |A study was carried out on 39 treated animals and on 31 control animals. Of the 39 treated animals, 5 were treated with a single exposure to acrosolized papain, and the rest were treated with single or repeated intratracheal 138 | Hospital Center, Bronx, New York 10461 instilations of papain. The control animals received cither no treatment or saline treatment intratracheally ot through inhalation exposure, ‘The animals treated with saline did not show any lung pathology. The animals treated with papaia showed a massive hernorshagic in- flammatory reaction immediately after the treatment, followed by the development of emphysema. The inital inflammatory reaction subsided within 1 week. ‘The physiological measurements were made at least 1 week ater the final teatment. An example of severe eo:phy- semua produced by teatment with aerosolized papain is Showa in Fig. 1. Details of the method of production of emphysema and the pathological findings will be re- ported elsewhere (5). ‘Although the animals teated with papain lost weight temporarily, they regained weight, and the distribution of age and body weight at the tine ofsacriGce was similar in the two groups, as shown in the Table 1. Immediately after the animal was sacrificed by a lethal dose of pentobarbital, the lung was carefully removed, together with the heart, and placed in a body plethys graph with the tachea tied around a conducting tube. The plediysmograph used was similar to the one de- scribed by Mead (8) (Fig. 2). The total air volume of the plethystuograph was approximately $ liters, and a Change of volume caused a pressure change of approx mately lem H.O. The pressure change in the plethysmo- sgraph was picked up by a sensitive pressure transducer (Statham PL5-0350) a8 a volume signal. ‘The flow was obtained by electric differentiation of this volume signal. ‘The calibration of volume and flow was carried out electrically as shown in the APPENDIX ‘Using a 10-ml syringe and monitoring the inflation by the airway presure, we slowly inflated the lungs of the control group until the airway presure reached ap- proximately 20-25 cm H,O pressure.

Alameda Avenue Suite A214 Burbank, CA 91523 Dear Mr. Zucker: am disappointed to have to be writing you again for the second time in less than a ‘month about the use of one of our cigarette brands in a plot line on one of your highly- rated prime-time programs. In this instance, dialogue referring to our Newport brand -- along with a product tagline —- ‘was scripted into a scene of the program ""Frasier,"" on an episode entitled ""Cranes Go Caribbean"" which aired on Tuesday, May 22. Both the Newport name and tagline are registered trademarks of Lorillard. In the scene, a female character, seen smoking a cigarette, expresses to Kelsey Grammar's “""Prasier Crane"" character that ""this Newport is more alive with pleasure than you are.” As I explained in my previous letter -- sent after our Newport Lights brand was used as a plot point in a late-April airing of ""Friends"" -- Lorillard Tobacco Company has no desire to utilize any broadcast medium to promote our products. In fact, as you may recall, the Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969 — which took effect in January 1971 — led to the elimination of all tobacco advertising on television and radio. In 1998, we voluntarily agreed to refrain from product placement in movies and television, a practice we already had abandoned decades ago. 97971066 Compote One: Mat 714 Green Valley Road PO.

"INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE May 14, 1980 Mr. G. R. Gunzenhauser: Re: R&D Smoking Behavior Research (PEP #3820) After several brief discussions with Carroll Tompson and Andy Laurene, I conclude we should forward the PEP to Mr. Horrigan for approval. I agree with you that this should have been included in the Revised Budget. Andy Laurene advises the 1980 cost will be approximately $70,000 rather than $150,000 as shown on the PEP. Also, it is not clear whether the proposed agreement is for 5 years, or 3-5 years, or year-to-year up to 5 years (see PEP and Carroll Tompson's memorandum) > Vege AEA Page As to funding, I would imagine this proposal, if abproved will not cause an overrun in R&D's 1980 budget. My understand- ing from Dr. Laurene is that they do have $30,000 to $40,000 in professional fees not committed. Perhaps unfilled budgeted positions would cover the rest. If not, R&D management has the responsibility to explain. In any event, I think the entire $70,000 should be shown as unbudgeted for 1980. Not well handled, but at this point I believe the PEP should go forward, after speaking to the several points above and any others you consider necessary. Ws R. A. Emken RAE: sw Attachment",0

Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report COPYRIGHT 1996 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Friday, February 16, 1996 Vol. 45, No. 6, ISSN: 0149-2195 Accessibility of tobacco products to youth aged 12-17 years - United States, 1989 and 1993 Although the sale of tobacco products to minors is illegal in all states and the District of Columbia (1), the prevalence of cigarette smoking among adolescents has continued to increase (2), and most minors are able to purchase tobacco products (3). Reducing sales to minors is believed to be an effective measure for reducing the prevalence of tobacco use (4). To determine recent patterns of minors’ access to tobacco products from retail outlets and vending machines, data were analyzed from the 1989 and 1993 Teenage Attitudes and Practices surveys (TAPS I and TAPS II). This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which indicate that most minors who use tobacco purchase their‘own tobacco and that small stores are the sources of most purchases. Samples for both TAPS I and II were drawn from households that participated in the National Health interview Survey (NHTS), a continuing nationwide household survey that collects information from a representative sample of the U.S. civilian, noninstitutionalized population aged (greater than or equal to] 18 years. Both TAPS I and IT collected information on adolescents’ knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding tobacco use. TAPS I data were collected by telephone interviews; TAPS II data were collected by telephone and personal interviews and included both a new probability sample and a follow-up of respondents from TAPS 1. Data for persons aged 12-17 years in each survey were analyzed (n=7773 for TAPS I; n=6165 for TAPS Ii) and weighted to provide national estimates. SUDAAN was used to calculate standard errors for determining 95% confidence intervals (cIs) and to perform multivariate logistic regression analyses of TAPS II data; simultaneous adjustments were made for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and region of the country. Differences between TAPS I and TAPS II for selected estimates were assessed by using the Generalized Estimating Equations software (5S). Adjustments were made for subject correlation and age. 9122096902 Adolescents in both TAPS I and II who were current smokers were asked about purchase practices, and all respondents were asked about perceived ease of purchase (6). In TAPS II, adolescents who usually bought, ever bought, or ever tried to buy their own cigarettes were Copr. (C) West 1998 No Claim to Orig: U.S. Govt. Works all",6

T am pleased to enclose a recent Annual Report that lists grants currently supported and a brochure describing policies of The Council. Our application procedure is a two-step process, comprising a preliminary inquiry and, if that is approved, a final proposal . To accomplish the first step, potential applicants should submit a brief (3 to 4 page) preliminary outline of the study for which support is sought. It should contain the following information: 1. A synopsis of the project under investigation, its present goals and status. 2. A brief outline of plans and goals for the proposed research, specifying the next steps to be taken. 3. Anticipated duration and annual direct costs of the study as proposed. Please note that The Council will only provide support for a maximum of 3 years. Although grants are made for one year at a time, up to two annual renewals can be considered on the basis of progress. reports and materials submitted with renewal applications. It would also be helpful to have: 1. Brief curricula vitae and scientific bibliographies of the applicant and principal professional level collaborators. The two-page NIH format is preferred for the preliminary inquiry. 2. One copy each of any two or three publications, abstracts or manuscripts that are closely related to the project for which funding is being sought. Preliminary inquires are evaluated by the Executive Committee of our Scientific Advisory Board for scientific merit and for ""fit"" into The Council’s current multidisciplinary biomedical research program. The reviewers either encourage or discourage submission of a formal detailed application for full competitive consideration. That process takes approximately two months. If the vote is to encourage, then appropriate forms and instructions are provided. Submission deadlines for full (not preliminary) applications are May 31 and November 30; activation is typically seven months later. Sincerely, Means Teall, i Harmon McAllister Enel HCM/mia",0

"NEWS Hutchinson, Kans. . Tnerease The Tax 30 Cents Jan. 16, 1964 0518 7F Helena, Mont. Both the Governor and the mem- ‘vers hope that the legislature's budg- et session can be completed without raising taxes. Except, of course, the levies on cigarettes and alcoholic bev- erages. But those don't count be- cause in Kansas they still are sym bols of sin. ‘The News strongly opposes adding another penny a package to the tax = on cigarettes. Tt does so simply be- cause that isn’t nearly enough. ‘The tax should be advanced at least 30 and perhaps even 50 cents. ‘This proposal, fantastic although it ” INDEPENDENT-RECORD Page 20 ay at first seem, would provide sev- eral millions a year in added revenue which the state needs badly, even though it undoubtedly would bring about a sharp drop in cigarette sales. But this is not the primary reason for making this recommeéndation. The News does so as a matter of public health. If Kansas once thought it vie tal to eliminate the common drinking ‘cup and the house fly, today in the light of the Surgeon General's com- mittee report, it should do what it feasibly can to discourage the use of Aigarettes. ven. 4, 196 Government Aid in Selling Poison Everybody's talking about cigarets, but we'll lay you 10 to one that nobody ‘ever does anything about them, In foct, we might even go farther and predict thet the United States govern- ment, which has raised the question of tthe smoker poisoning himself in a multi- tude of different ways through his use of the weed, will go right along helping him in the process. For the biggest foundation to the tobacco industry is.the subsidy which the Department of Agriculture pays to ‘tobacco growers who hove skillfully man- ‘eged to keep production high in spite of restriction of supported ocreage. In other words, we undoubtedly will see the federal compaign against the tse of tobacco gother impetus while the government continues to pay formers for raising it. ‘And, at the same time everyone will debate about what should be done. Some will say thet the tobacco industry should not be allowed to advertise. Some will say that the type of advertising shuld be censored. Some will want a counter rogram to advertise the ills which result from the use of tobacco. We would give ‘dds that none of these will be adopted ‘end would not produce much in the way of results if they were, If we were serious about stopping. or reducing the use of tobacco there ore two simple steps which would be effec- tive ‘One would be to cut off the support to the tobacco grower. This could even be reversed by requiring @ license for the privilege of growing @ poison weed and charging a tax for each acre planted, Then the government could double its tox on the finished product, @ tax which already is the biggest factor in the re- toil price. Few are going to quit smoking because they are ofraid of lung cancer or any other disease, They know that it is al- ways the other fellow who is stricken.

"Inhalati - by E, Cuyler Hammond, Se.D.* Irving J. Selikoff, M.D.** Patrick J, Lawther, M.D.‘ Both cigarette smoke and polluted urban air mn of Benzypyrene and Cancer in Man \ contain very small amounts of benzo(a)pyrene, or BaP, a substance which is carcinogenic to experimental animals if reletively large amounts are applied in certain ways such as skin painting or subcutaneous injection. This suggested the possibility that the BaP in cigarette smoke might account for the high degree of association between cigarette smoking and lung cancer; and it suggested the possibility that BaP pollution of urban air might perhaps increase the risk of lung cancer~ Wynder and Hoffman found an average of 2.5 micrograms of BaP in the smoke from 100 American cigarettes smoked mechanically. Based upon this, it would appeer that even during a 1ifetine of heavy cigarette snoking, the con centration of BaP per square centimeter of bronchial t: be spread would be extremely small as compared with th skin cancer in mice. ‘The concentration of BaP in the air of large Jesue over which it might e dose required to produce American cities is reported to vary from about 0.3 to 6.0 micrograms per 1,000 cubic meters in sumner and from 6.0 to as high as 74.0 in winter.

LEWIS Department of Pathology, Huntingdon Research Cenire, Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire PEV8 6ES (Accepted 1S August 1980) inrRopuction Cell renewal in the epithelium of the various levels of the respiratory tract does not occur at a uniform rate (Bertalanffy, 1968), instead it varies, even between cranial and caudal regions of the trachea (Bolduc & Reid, 1976). Several studies hhave investigated the mitotic activity in the rat trachea, bronchi, bronchioles and alveoli (Rertalanffy & LeBiond, 1953; Spencer & Shorter, 1962; Bertalanfty, 1964; Shorter, Titus & Divert, 1964: Shorter, Titus & Divertie, 1966; Blenkinsopp, 1967; Wells, 1970). However, no studies of mitotic activity of rat largyngeal epithelium hhave been traced. The larynx, in comparison with other regions of the respiratory tract, contains five distinct ‘epithelial types identifiable by electron microscopy: squamous, squamoid, respiratory and two cuboidal forms (Lewis & Prentice, 1980; Lewis, 1980), ‘The present study briefly describes the histological appearances of the various epithelial types from one micron sections and reports their mitotic indices in det MATERIALS AND METHODS Forty male, specific pathiogen-free CFHB Wistar-derived, albino rats (average weight 200) were obtained from Anglia Laboratory Animals, Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire. Immediately on arrival five rats were killed and the lungs, trachea and larynges examined histologically to assess the degree of chronic inflammatory cell infiltration, and therefore the suitability of the rats for experimentation. The remaining rats were maintained under strict barriered conditions for a 2 weeks acclimatization period, after which time four rats were given intraperitoneal injections of 0:1 mg per 190 g body weight of colchicine (Sigma Chemical Co., London) in sterile isotonic saline, The injections commenced at 10.00 am and successive animals were dosed at intervals of five minutes. Exactly 4 hours after the injection each rat was killed by an: intraperitoneal injection of sodium. pento- barbitone. In addition, one rat was given an intraperitoneal injection of isotonic saline as a vehicle control. This experiment with: four colchicine and one control rat was subsequently: repeated on six occasions. ‘The tongue, pharynx, larynx and trachea were removed. en masse and the larynx carefully dissected free, and fixed in 4% glutaraldehyde in 0-1 m cacodylate butfer, pH 73, at 4°C, for 3 hours. The larynges were then cut transversely into = 1 mm rings, washed in buffer and post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide.

"Appendix = Nava Seoev Requirement of Nucleotide Exchange Factor for Ypt1 GTPase Mediated Protein Transport Sara Jones,* Robert J. Lit {,) Celeste J. Richardson,’ and Nava Segev** Departnents af “Pharmacological and Physiological Sciences, Molecular Geneties and Cel Biology und Biochemistry and Molecalar Biology, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Ilinois 60637 Abstract. Small GTPases of the rab family are involved in the regulation of vesicular transport. Itis believed that cycling between the GTP- and GDP-bound forms, ‘and accessory factors regulating thi cycling are crucial for rab function, However, an essential rote for rab mu- cleotide exchange factors has not yet been demon- strated, In this report we show the requirement of nu- cleotide exchange factor activity for Yptl GTPase ‘mediated protein transport. The Yptl protein, a mem- ber ofthe rab family, plays a role in targeting vesicles to the acceptor compartment and i essential for the first two steps ofthe yeast secretory pathway. We use two YPTT dominant mutations that contain alterations in & highly conserved GTP-binding domain, N/2/F and DI2AN. YPTL-DI24N isa novel mutation that encodes a protein with nucleotide specificity modified from gun- nine to xanthine. This provides a tool for the study of an individual rab GTPase in crude extracts: a xan- thosine triphosphate (XTP)-dependent conditional dominant mutation, Both mutations confer growth in- hibition and a block in protein secretion when cx- pressed in vivo, The purified mutant proteins do not bind either GDP or GTP. Moreover, they completely inhibit the ability of the exchange factor to sti nucleotide exchange for wild type Yptt prote potent inhibitors of ER to Golgi transport in the vesicle targeting step. The inhibitory effects of the ‘Yptl-D124N mutant protein on both nucleotide ex- change activity and protein transport in vitro can be re- lieved by XTP, indicating that it isthe nucleotide-free form of the mutant protein that is inhibitory. These re~ sults suggest that the dominant mutant proteins inhibit protein transport by sequestering the exchange factor from the wild type Ypt] protein, and that this factor has an essential role in vesicular transport. ‘way involves their orderly progression through ase~ ries of membranous compartments (Palade, 1975). ‘Transport between successive secretory compartments ap- pears to be mediated by vesicles (Jamieson and Palade, 41067; Pfeffer and Rothman, 1987; Rothman, 1994). How. fever, the mechanisms that regulate the directionality and specificity ofthese vesicular transport steps are not known, ‘The rab/¥ptl/See4 family of small GTPases has been shown to play a role in vesicular trafficking (Ferro-Novick nd Novick, 1993; Zerial and Stenmark, 1993). t hus been suagested that these proteins act at the different steps of the secretory pathway to ensure the fidelity of vesicular targeting (Bourne, 1988; Segev et al., 1988; Lian et al., 1984; Spgarrd et al, 1994). The ability of rab proteins to ‘eycle between GTP- and GDP-bound forms is believed to be crucial for their function (Bourne, et al., 1990).

Most GTP-bind- ing proteins have slow intrinsic rates of guanine nucleotide eachange, and thus requite accessory factors to stimulate the exchange reaction “The importance of nucleotide exchange for function of rab-G TPases has been implied in several studies. Fist, rab proteins thet have a mutation analogous to ras-SI7N, Which tocks the GTPase in the GDP-bound form, have been shovn to inhibit protein transport in vivo and in vitro (Tisdale et al, 1992; Li and Stahl, 1993; Nuoffer et al, 1994; Riederer et a, 1994; Stenmark et al. 1994), Second, the balk ofthe cytosolic pool of several rab proteins is ap parently in the GDP-bound state, since itis found in a Complex with GDP-dissociation inhibitory factor (GDI)! 5.

Abboud Department of lnternal Medicine and Cardiovascular Center, University of lov'a College of Medicine, Towa City, fowa, US. Hypoxia and hypercapnia impose circulatory and metabolic stresses on the body. Responses to these sresses include both local and reflex mechanisms that attempt to restore homeostasis and maintain perfusion of the most vital and sensitive organs, such as the brain and the heart. Increased ventilation, which is a reflex response, aims to restore normoxia and/or normocap- nia. Both hypoxia and hypercapnia also exert local vasodilatory effects. Chemorefiex-mediated sympa thetic vasoconstriction acts in opposition to the local vasodilatory effects, except in the cerebral and coro- nary circulations. Thus, the integrated response con- sists of hyperventilation, peripheral vasoconstriction and cerebral and coronary vasodilation. This inte- grated response is further influenced by other factors, including ventilation itself, interactions between hyp- xia and hypercapnia, the severity of hypoxia and oth- erreflexes, such asthe arterial baroreflexes. This review will examine the role of the chemoreflexes in the re- sponses to hypoxia and hypercapnia, interactions that significantly modulate the chemoreflex responses and the importance of the chemoreflexes in mediating the cardiovascular responses to sleep apnea.

In humans, ‘evidence that the peripheral chemoreceptors ate the primary mediators of the reflex responses to hypoxia are based on data showing that carotid body cener- vation and resection result in an elimination of the ventilatory response to hypoxia, At very tow levels of oxygen tension, however (PO, < 40 mm Hg), hypoxia elicits a central pressor reflex resulting in increases in systemic arterial pressure (8-10). Furthermore, at ex- tremely low levels of oxygen tension, failure of vaso- motor regulatory control may result in widespread cir- culatory collapse. Hypercapnia acts via central chemoreceptors (11).

"May 30, 1990 Mayor Donald M. Fraser 350 South Fifth Street, Room 127 Minneapolis, Minnesota 55415 Dear Mayor Fraser: Your city clerk, Merry Keefe, recently sent our company a copy of Resolution 90R-162, ""Urging R.J. Reynolds Company to cease planned cigarette advertising campaigns aimed at youth, people of color and young women."" On behalf of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. and its 12,500 employees, I object to the fact that the Minneapolis government has passed a resolution that grossly misleads the public about our company and our products. First, you urge our company to stop doing something that we are not doing. We do not advertise or wish to promote our products to anyone under the age of 18. Nor do we have any interest or engage in any activity designed to encourage nonsmokers, regardless of age, to start smoking. Our company's sole focus is trying to convince current adult smokers that our brands are more desirable than those of our competitors. Reynolds Tobacco manufactures and markets a legal product that is enjoyed daily by 50 million Americans, and we don't need to make any excuses for what we do. If you are an adult who currently smokes, we want your business; if you are not, we don't. It simple as that, and anyone who accuses us of acting otherwise either misinformed or intentionally misrepresenting what we do. Second, concerning the resolution's accusations about ""people of color and young women,"" our products are marketed to all current adult smokers and are enjoyed by male and female adults of virtually every racial and ethnic background. In our opinion, your resolution is extremely patronizing to those individuals you purport to protect. You are assuming that these adults do not’ have the intelligence and common sense to make up their own minds about common lifestyle choices, such as smoking. Third, if you are going to accuse us of intentionally trying to take advantage of people and harm their health, you should present all of the facts, not just those that. support your bias. Your resolution states that ""numerous studies have demonstrated causal links between smoking and increased cases of cancer, coronary heart disease, chronic lung diseases and low birth weight babies 99S TLL05",0

We have examined the expression of germline C, transcripts (,-C, transcripts) in splenic B cells and pre-B cell lines after cytokine and mitogen stimulation. In contrast to the expression of the germline transcripts from downstream C, genes, expression of germline C, transcripts was constitutive and unaffected by mitogen and cytokine treatment. After a primary switch recombination event, the germline |, promoter, which is now associated with a downstream C, gene, continues to be active—leading to the generation of a novel germline transcript consisting of the I, exon spliced to the Cy exons of the switched C, gene. We discuss the potential role of the expression of hybrid |,-containing transcripts in the class switch process. We also describe a novel and sensitive assay, based on the detection of the hybrid L-containing transcripts, that allows detection of class switch Introduction During 8 cell devetopment, the antigon binding domain of the ig molecule sintialy associated wih the «and 6 constant region genes allowing the Ig 0 be expressed as an IgM oF IgD protein B calls have the potential to change the effector function of ther ig molecules by undergoing a recombination event, termed Ig heavy chain class switching (reviewed in 1-3). Class switch recombination occurs between repettve sequences caled simteh regions (S regions) located 5 to all of the Cy, genes (except 3). Evidence suggests that class switching usually involves recombination between the S region of C, and that of a downstream C, gene and subsequent deletion of the intervening sequences (4 - 6).

"Biology Elizabeth Pennisi reports From Sarasoa, Fla, atthe annual meeting ofthe Association for Chemoreception Sciences Foods that fool the body with low fat Nutritionists and food companies may have more success promoting healthy diets If they concentrate on reducing fat in specific foods. Unfortunately, ice cream isnt one of them. People can judge the fat content of milk-based products ‘much more easily than the fat in mixed foods, such as chicken salad, report Beverly J. Tepper and Susan E. Shaffer of Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N. ‘Tepper and Shaffer tested the ability of 73 people to judge the richness of various foods. Each person visited the research lab twice weekly for two weeks. At each five versions of six common foods. The looked and tasted the same but varied in fat content and texture. Inone est, participants judged the relative fat contents of the different versions by comparing them to one another; in another test conducted ona different day, they estimated théfat content of each version separately. In neither test could participants accurately judge the fat content of scrambled eggs or chicken spread, Tepper says, but in both tests they succeeded in ranking mashed potatoes and pudding — two milk-based foods. They also distinguished the Telative richness of crunchy snacks fried in different oils. “In some foods, people are going to notice the difference {in fat content}, but'in others, you can make relatively large ‘changes without people noticing,” Tepper concludes. Alzheimer’s disease: Does the nose know? {An insidious disease, Alzheimer’s can start to develop long. before one can detect troublesome losses in cognitive function. However, people with this disease also lose some of their sense ‘of smell. Researchers hope that monitoring changes in this sense will help them detect the disease earlier and aid in tracking its progression. “The goal is to develop an early marker or something that ‘could {change} along with the disease,” explains Jack Pearl of the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders in Bethesda, Md. “An olfactory test is a relatively noninvasive way of testing” ‘Toward that end, several research groups have begun studying the ability of older people, with and without Alzheim- e's, to detect and remember odors, Ina study conducted at the University of California, San Diego, Medical Center, 65 people with Alzheimer’s disease and ‘82 healthy people of similar ages and backgrounds underwent vision, taste, and odor tests. The vision and taste components. helped the scientists determine whether the participants were ‘of sound enough mind for testing and whether deterioration had occurred in more than one sensé ‘One of the odor tests required participants to sniff alcohol from pairs of plastic squeeze bottles and pick out the one with the stronger scent. By supplying bottles with different concen- trations of alcohol, the researchers could tell at what concen- tration the person first detected the odor. The same people also sipped sugar water samples with differing degrees of sweet- ness and were asked to spit out the sweeter one. Participants with Alzheimer’s needed much stronger odors than the healthy sniffers, say Claire Murphy and Steven Nordin, who led the study. “The more demented [the person], the higher the threshold, but there was no such correlation for taste,"" adds Nordin. “The research suggests there isa specific detection dysfunction to odors.” Furthermore, he notes, in the seven people with Alzheimer’s disease who have now been tested for three years, the average yearly change in the odor-detection threshold has correlated with the progression of dementi A second experiment assessed the participants’ ability to recognize odors they had smelled earlier. Each person looked 300 at 10 faces of presidents and 10 engineering symbols and ‘smelled 10 common household odors. They then examined a second set of faces, symbols, and odors, half of which came from the first set. Participants tended to score the same when rating familiar faces and symbols as when rating odors they had sniffed earlier. But Alzheimer's patients scored lower ‘overall, indicating a general decline in memory, says Nordin. At Duke University in Durham, NC., psychologist Susan S. ‘Schiffman and her colleagues track changes in healthy people ‘who are at risk of developing Alzheimer’s. So far, the study involves 22 such individuals and 22 people matched for age, ‘gender, race, level of education, and handedness who are not, ‘considered at risk or the disease, Participants undergo several tests, including ones in which they pick the stronger of two flavors or odors and are asked to remember familiar ones. ‘The twogroups differ only intheirability toremember odors, reports Brevick G. Graham of Duke. “I wouldnt suggest that [odor testing] would ever replace any ‘of the cognitive measures, but it might be used in addition to ‘other things for early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s.” he says. There's no accounting for taste Countless studies have indicated that animals avoid bitter foods. But some actually prefer acrid flavors, reports John 1. Glendinning of the University of Arizona in Tucson. While Glendinning was at Florida State University in Tal- lahassee, he studied the eating habits of two species of wild Mexican mice. He discovered that while none of the Peromyscus ‘melanotismice liked bitter flavors, seven of 64 Peromyscus azteca mice preferred quinine water over regular water. He then offered both species hop extract, tannic acid, and two other bitter ‘substances. “These chemicals are realy different, bt neverthe- less they all elicit similar responses,” Glendinning told Science. News, “individuals that prefer quinine were more likely to prefer ‘other bitter chemicals” up to a certain concentration. Glendinning calls this the “Schweppes effec,” after the tonic water that some people prefer over regular water. Citing other studies showing that some goats, opossums, and squirrel monkeys like bitter foods, he suggests that many animals ‘exhibit this effect, although he doesn't really know why. He suspects, however, that in foods — particularly plants — bitterness may reflect higher nutritional content. How sweet a protein can be ‘A reddish fruit sold in Nigerian markets has provided scientists with yet another supersweet protein. Ounce per ‘ounce, this S2-amino-acld protein, called brazzein, provides 2000 times the sweetness of sugar, reports Ding Ming, @ biochemist atthe University of Wisconsin-Madison. He and Wisconsin colleague Gran Hellekant isolated the protein from Pantadiplandra brazzeana, a vine plant that produces a fruit, slightly bigger than a grape. “The sugar [content] isnot that high; we guess thatthe sweet protein plays the same role as sugar,” says Ming. Sweetness may_ encourage animals to eat such fruits and help disperse seeds, he explains. Brazzeins lysine-rich amino acid sequence beats tittle resemblance to those of other sweet proteins (SN: 5/19/90, 315), which tend to contain many more amino acids, says Ming. This protein also proves quite stable, surviving 98°C temperatures for at least two hours. and’ maintaining. its sweetness in a wide range of acidic and alkaline solutions, the researchers report. Moreover, electrical recordings from taste ‘nerves of primates reveal thatthe protein elicits a purely sweet sensation, with no aftertaste. The Wisconsin scientists have applied for a patent for the protein, ‘SCIENCE NEWS, VOL. 143, 89EL09E902",6

"Suvpar, JUNE 5, 1994 onuaatyunnicis Cd, ee Ps Chet ehingte fost eee Commentary and Opinion UTLOOK The Marlboro Math Forget the Cigarette Tax Hike; Smokers Already Pay Their Share By Jane Gravelle and Dennis Zimmerman, everything about President Clinton's health care reform package, with one notable exception. A ‘vast majority favors the proposed 75-cent tax on a pack of cigarettes. Were one to be cynical, such support ‘ight be explained by the fact that only about a quarter of adult Americans smoke, so that the majority of us anticipate receiving health care paid for by others. For- tunately, a more charitable—and conventional—expla- nation exists: that the 25 percent of American adults ‘who smoke impose great costs on nonsmokers, thus a 75-cent tax increase would compensate nonsmokers for these social, or “external,” costs. If true, nonsmok- ers can rest easy knowing that imposition of a cigarette tax isnot only in their financial best interest, but is also abundantly fair. But is it, in fact, fair? Let’s take a look at the evi- dence. The financial costs smokers impose on non- ‘smokers have been extensively examined in a 1991 study funded by the Rand Corp. Updating the study's mid-range estimate to 1995 price levels yields a net external cost of smoking of $3 cents per pack. Since ccurrent federal, state and local taxes are 50 cents per ‘Jane Gravelle and Dennis Zimmerman are economists ‘atthe Cor Research Service of the Library of Congress. The views expressed are their own. A ‘merican taxpayers seem to disagree on almost pack or more on average, the RAND-sponsored study suggests that smokers are already paying more than their way. ‘These modest spillover costs may seem inexplicable in light ofthe assertions of organizations that advocate tax- es far larger than 75 cents per pack. But the Rand study ‘makes some critical distinctions many of those organiza- tions don't aclnowledge. For instance, the Rand study identifies ‘al of the costs and benefits that smokers im- ‘pose on others—and excludes the costs smokers pay for themselves. Thus, the study includes as external costs only that portion of smokers’ excess medical expendi- tures (49 cents per pack) and sick leave costs (1 cent per pack) not paid by smokers, the higher life and fire insur ‘ance premiums due to smoking (7 and 3 cents per pack respectively) and the lost tax revenve smokers would ‘have paid to retirement and health programs had they not died prematurely (12 cents per pack). ‘Additionally, the authors of the Rand study include the offsetting savings that smokers’ premature death pro- vides to nonsmokers—an obvious but often overlooked factor. After al, the alternative to death from a smoking- related illness is not immortality and perfect health—itis later death, and perhaps from a more costly illness (net- ted out in the 49 cents per pack above) or larger nursing home casts (a 6 cent offset per pack). Nonsmokers may not realize it, but they also benefit from the pension and See SMOKE, C4, Col-1 Page lof 3 TIMN 0031701",9
"The Associated Press ‘Team Penske driver Gil de Ferran of Brazil rounds the first turn at Road America near Elkhart Lake on Friday.

Two types of beating, venillaiing and aircon <Altiontng (HVAC) systems were examined: constant air tolume (CAV) and variable air volume (VAY). Two types of smoking policy were examined: unrestricted smoking land smoking restricted 10 designated lounges. Toe four ‘buildings represented allcombinations ofthese four vari- ‘ables. One floor of each building was investigated, wi measurements conducted during tbe summer when HVAC tems were not in economizer mode, bey used ‘minimal outcide air, Inspections of tbe HVAC systems Indicated that ther operation and maintenance were acceptable, Ventilation wae measured by standard pro- Cadre based on vlocly traverses. ‘During the ets, al oureystems provided ventilation rates exentally conforming 10 ASHRAE Standard 62- 1989. ndicatorsofairqualily avd environmental bac co smoke (ETS) were determined in outside and returvairsireanss and offices 1AQ indicators included respirable suspended particles (RSP), formaldehyde, tolaile organic compounds (VOC), carbon dioxide (C02) and carbon monaxide (CO). ETS indicators fn- ‘duded ulravolet particulate maiter(UVPM), fluorescent particulate maiter(FPM) and nicotine. Smoking activity twat assessed by collecting and counting cigarette buts, Results show that: (@) smoking activity bad a neglt- _gible efect on contaminant levels in buildings were Smoking was unrestricted; (b) resriciing smoking 10 lounges eliminated ronsmoker exposure to ETS by preventing smoke from dispersing fo adjacent areas; and (with be HVAC systems adequately designed, operated fn aceordasice with the current ASHRAE Standard and properly maintained, all indicators were well within ‘opplicable standards, regardless ofthe smoking policy. APPENDIX F INTRODUCTION ‘Over the past decade there has been an increasing awareness of the role thatthe indoor environment can have in determining tol exposure to airbome con- taminants, A considerable amount of research has been done to ascess exposures in various microenvironments such ashomes, offices, restaurants, and aircraft cabins to lis but a few, Research also has been done to assess exposure to specifi classes of contaminants, such 25 volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Partof our research program [Oldaker, 1990] has been directed at assessing exposure in offices (0 environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), which is defined as the diluted and aged mire of sidestream smoke and exhaled mainsiream smoke ‘which originates from buming tobacco (National Re search Counll, 1986. ‘Generally, the level ofa contaminant in the indoor airisthe result ofthe interplay between the sources of the ‘contaminant and factors that remove the contami fee, “sinks” For most contaminants, ventilation isthe rain removal factor.

This consensus standard gives two procedures for demonstrating acceptable indoor air ‘quality (AQ). One procedure involvesassessing whether Ventilation rates, generally in terms of cubic feet pet ‘minute (CFM) outdoor air per occupant, conform with ‘Values tabulated in the Standard on the basis of microen vironment, The other procedure involves measuring levels of contaminants to ensure that they are within specified levels, “The investigations reported here were done because there existed no quantitative information on the effect of smoking on office 1AQ within the context of ASHRAE Standard 62-1989, X Q Ry & oe nm cS 8",6

All products were prepared on the 6-8-6 maker and had a 20.0mm finished circumference. Six prototypes were prepared with Ecusta papers; the remaining prototypes were made with Kimberly-Clark papers. Constant tobacco rod packing density at a high and a low level was achieved with blends containing 10% and 50% expanded tobacco. All samples were produced successfully at target weight and circumference. Given the complexity of the experimental design, successful execution of this portion of the test is a great accomplishment. It is largely due to the care exercised in setting ranges within the experimental design (the work of T. A.

The smoke was trapped in ascorbic acid solution Dutflered at pl 4.$ and extracted with cichloromethane, and the organic phase was chromatographed and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography-thermal energy ani lyzer methodology (sensitivity. 250 pg/injection). The nonvol- ale nitrosamines were further enriched by repeated chroma- tography and positively identified by gas-liquid chrometogra- Dhy-mass spectrometry.

"TITLE: Tobacco restriction today, what tomorrow? BYLINE: Joe Hawkins CREDIT: SPECIAL TO THE BANNER EST, PAGES: 2 : 01/05/96 NSHV22827 Nashville Banner; NSHV SECTION: News; PAGE: Al3 (Copyright 1996) column: COMMUNITY VOICES There is an issue currently facing Tennesseans and their agricultural heritage that is much more complex than would be realized at first glance. The issue is that of regulatory jurisdiction of tobacco-related products For those Tennesseans not involved in agriculture production or non-tobacce users, the issue vould seem even more insignificant than However, this is an issue of tremendous importance to Last year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced a far-reaching plan to exercise regulatory control over the marketing and sale of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. The foundation for this action is based on the FDA assumption that tobacco products are a delivery device of nicotine Two major concerns arise from this regulatory initiative. While the anti-tobacco forces of today's society argue that the tobacco issue should be addressed without regard to economics, it is unrealistic to do so. Economics cannot be disregarded for it is the very purpose of the production process. Tobacco producers do not grow tebacco to create a ‘‘drug delivery system.'! Tebacco producers grow tobacco in order to pay the bills that in turn help maintain other business activity. Production has, through the years, passed on a strong work ethic, an ability to provide for a family on limited production resources, land significant economic benefit to the local, state and federal tax revenue. It has clothed, fed and educated a significant number of Tennesseans. It is interesting to note that Tennessee passed a temporary tax in 1925 on tobacco products to fund education. That tax was made permanent in 1927, and in 1994 resulted in an excess of $84 million for education. No other product can compete with that contribution, just as no other product can offer the return on investment to the Producer. If the demand for any product provided the production incentive of tobacco, producers would respond. Alternative crops are often suggested, however, if a major shift to any other production was successful without major marketing network changes for that production, chaos and bankruptcy would be the result for many. Aside from economics, another major concern arises from this FDA TI1686-0058",9

Exceptions: 4, Their assessment of the mammalian call transformation assay deviates from our ex: perience. The study cited by BNW does not support their view that thie essay has been verified to discriminate cigarette types, because Piao and Hel 1) used a study design which differs from the proposed one (2 times more culturesjcigarette type, compensation of cytotoxicity by replating, and administration of lonizing radiation); 2) could, In spite of these modifications, achieve a relative sensitivity of 2 only (Le. specific genotoxicity of test and reference cigarette have to deviate by a factor of at jeast 2 before the assay discriminates both).

"813 Original Contributions Localization of Muscarinic Receptor mRNAs in Rat Heart and Intrinsic Cardiac Ganglia by In Situ Hybridization Donald B. Hoover, Ronald H. Baisden, Sylvia X. Xi-Moy Abstract Although the heart is considered relatively pure source of m2 muscarinic receptors, the posible expression of ‘other muscarinic receplor genes at diserete sites within the myocardium of by intrinsic cardiac ganglia had not been ‘valued. Accordingly, the resent sudy used in sit hybrid ization histochemistry with *Sslabeled oligonucleotide probes to address this issu, Initial experiments demonstrated thatthe localization of m2 mRNA was similar to that reported for muscarinic receptors labeled withthe nonselective muscarinic antagonist guinuelidiny! benaiate; however, there were two important exceptions. The condvcting system contained less message than expected, whereas the intrinsic cardiac ganglia contained more. The mismatch between muscarinic recepior ‘and m2 mRNA densities in the conducting system could not be ‘explained by the local expression of other muscarinic receptor genes, since mi, m3, and m4 mRNAs were not detected at this uscarinic receptors located at a diversity of sites are known to contribute to the neuro- regulation of cardiac fonction. Postjune~ tional cholinergic receptors on the myocardium have ‘been most thoroughly studied and can directly elicit negative chronotropic, dromotropic, or inotropic re- sponses when uctivated by muscarinic agonists or the stimulation of cholinergic nerves.!> Muscarinic recep- tors are also associated with cholinergic and adrenergic nerves in the heart.'** These prejunctional receptors have an inhibitory influence on the release of acetyl- choline and norepinephrine and presumably have a role in fine-tuning the amount of neurotransmitter available to interact with postjunctional receptors. Last, musca- rinic receptors are present on efferent neurons of the cardiac ganglia, where they may have a role in modu- lating ganglionic neurotransmission.""""""? ‘An additional level of complexity has been added by the discovery of multiple muscarinic receptor subtypes. Five muscarinic receptor genes have been identified in molecular cloning experiments, and the corresponding receptor proteins have been designated ml through m5.!\* Heterogeneity of muscarinic receptors has also been documented in functional and radioligand binding, experiments with muscarinic antagonists, Although the ‘Received January 12, 1989; accepied July 20, 194, From the Departments of Pharmacology (D.BLH, SX.X-M) ‘and Anatony (RHLB.), James H.

Accordingly, it is still possible that other muscarinic receptor genes might be expressed at dis- crete sites within the myocardium. ‘The distribution of muscarinic receptors in rat heart was evaluated in a previous study by in vitro receptor autoradiography with ['HJquinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) a nonselective muscarinic antagonist.” These exper ‘ments revealed a regional variation in the density of ‘muscarinic receptors within the heart, with levels being highest in the atria, sinoatrial (SA) node, atrioventrie ular (AV) node, bundle of His, and intrinsic cardiac ganglia. The present study was initiated to evaluate the localization of m2 mRNA in rat heart by in situ hybrid- ization histochemistry and to determine the extent t0 Which the distribution and abundance of message for this receptor subtype correspond to that of muscarinic receprors.

"© 1994 Oxford University Press Nucleic Acids Research, 1994, Vol, 22, No. 25 S695~S701 The fate of deleted DNA produced during programmed genomic deletion events in Tetrahymena thermophila Serge V.Saveliev and Michael M.Cox* Department of Biochemistry, University of Wisconsin, 420 Henry Mall, Madison. WI 53706, USA Recoved August 10, 1994; Revised and Accepted November 4, 1994 GenBank accession nos: U12971 and U12972 ABSTRACT Thousands of DNA deletion events occur during macronuclear development in the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila. In two deleted genomic regions, designated M and R, the eliminated sequences form circles that can be detected by PCR. However, the Circles are not normal products of the reaction pathway. The circular forms occur at very low levels in conjugating cells, but are stable. Sequencing analysis showed that many of the circles (as many as 50% of those examined) reflected a precise deletion in the M and R regions. The remaining circles were either smaller of larger and contained varying lengths of Sequences derived from the chromosomal DNA surrounding the eliminated region. The chromosomal junctions left behind after deletion were more precise, although deletions in either the M or R regions can generate any of several alternative junctions (1). Some ew chromosomal junctions were detected in the present study. The results suggest that the deleted segment is released as a linear DNA species that is degraded rapidly. This species is only rarely converted to the stable circles we detect. The deletion mechanism is different from those proposed for deletion events in hypotrichous ciliates (2-4), and does not reflect a conservative site-specific recombination process such as that promoted by the bacteriophage \ integrase (5). INTRODUCTION Ciliated protozoa provide examples of multiple types of progratnmied genomic rearrangements (6). These organisms have ‘wo nuclei, a micronucleus and a macronucleus, The ‘mieromucleus is transeriptionaly inactive and isan analog of an inactive germ cell nucleus. The larger macronucleus is teanscriptionally active and is an analog of a somatic nucleus. ‘Nutritional starvation induces cels of different mating types to undergo conjugation, The conjugants exchange haploid gametic nuclei to form diploid zygotic nuclei. Subsequent steps include mitotic divisions of zygotic nuclei the products of which give rise to new micronuclei and macronuclei. Old macronuclei are gradually degraded. In Tetrahymena thermophila, the entire process is completed in about 20 h. Macronuclear development in ciliates is accompanied by a variety of DNA rearrangements, including the elimination of 3 substantial portion of the micronuclear genome (7). la T.thermophita, about 15% of the genome is eliminated in the form of about 6800 site-specific deletion events, averaging 2 Kop insize and scatered about the genome. A striking feature otis type of DNA rearrangement is its high efficiency and precision Deletion ofall the MIC (micronucleus)-specifie sequences occurs ‘during a 2 period of macronuclear development, commencin about 10— 12 after mating is initiated. The mechanism expioited to bring about genomic deletions is unknown, ‘Three site-specific deletions in T.shermophila have been characterized hy Yao and co-workers (6). They occur within & short genomic region and are designated L, M, and R for let ‘middle, and right, respectively. The M region isthe best-stuied Here, two different deletion events may occur, deleting either 600 or 900 bp (Figure 1B). The boundaries of the deleted segments are marked by S$ or 8 bp terminal direct ry although these have no identified role in the deletion process Short polypurine tracts, found about 45 bp distal w each temninal repeat, are required for deletion and represent the only cis-acting sequences defined to dute tora ciliate deletion reaction (8. 9) ‘Their location defines the deetion erapoints inthe M region (9), The polypurine tracts are absent in the neighboring R region, hich also undergoes a deletion of 1.1 kbp (10) A promising direction in the investigation of the mechanism of genomic rearrangements in ciliates is analysis ofthe products fr byproducts that appear during the process. In Euplotes erassus the eliminated fragments derived from the deletion oi ES: elements or the transposon-like Tee and Tee? elements can be detected as circles (11 =13). The circle junctions contain 1wo copies of the terminal direct repeat separated by a short se of heteroduplex DNA derived from the chromosomal 1 Nanking the eliminated segment (2. 3). The data permited the authors to propose a detailed mode! for the deletion mechanism The deleted TBEL elements of Osyzricha mifallax are also found as readly-detected circular species with defined structures (4) We have begun an investigation of genomic deletions in the M and Ro regions during macronuclear development in Thermophila. By weans of PCR techniques we have detected circular forms of the eliminated sequences. However. the citcles are found in much lower abundance than those observed in “To stm core lens sok! be ares",6

Orientation is unaffected by removal of all three positively charged residues in the cytoplasmic loop or by deletion of all but 12 residues from the N- terminal domain. The residual —2 Neerminal charge apperently provides a signal sufficient to determine Nass topology. This is entirely consistent with the tatle tically derived rule in which the charge difference, A(C-N), counted for the 15 immediately flanking real: ues, is the primary topology determinant. Mutations altering A(C-N) to zero favors Noxy insertion by 8 to 1, whereas increasingly negative values cause increasing inversion of orientation. All results are consistent with the charge difference rule and indicate that whereas pos- itive charges promote eytoplaamle retention, negative charges promote translocation.

"September 9, 1982 To: Mr. E. J. Fackelman FROM: K. V. McCaffrey RE: Project AA With regards to your memo of September 2, let me say that while I don't disagree with the premise that imagery concepts are the most difficult to develop and refine on the down side, I do feel that the upside of Project AA has been completely overlooked. 1. To put it in your words, I view Project AA as being ""corrective"" imagery and not ""compatible"" imagery. If the designer name was Calvin Klein then I would say that AA is in a ""compatible"" image mode. However, Yves Saint Laurant is a high fashion Paris designer who is viewed as having distinctive sophisticated products which young adult female smokers want to be able to afford in their later years but cannot attain at this time. ‘The strength that I see in Project AA is a distinctive product coupled with a reinforcing image that could generate a very positive appeal. This premise is based on women's return to femininity. But I don't mean femininity in the traditional sense. Today's femininity includes not only physical attractiveness but also includes intelligence, independence, self-confidence and the ability to successfully lead a full, rich life. The sexual . revolution is not part of today's 18-24 year old woman. They assume that all avenues of opportunity are open to them but they want to project themselves as attractive women not neuter gender. 2. Project AA's main benefit to its target group is a cigarette that has a distinctively subtle taste (not overpowering) that is better than other brands on the market today. The reason or support for why this cigarette is better is due to the designer name influence. This influence causes expectations of a distinctive product that must be provided or consumers will feel they have been mislead. (As information, a formal positioning statement will be issued the week of September 13.) However, the bottom line is a subtly distinctive product with a subtly distinctive image carrier. 3. While it was known from the beginning that the odds of finding a solution to the 18-24 year old Corporate gap were minimal, Executive Management felt that at least we might gain some usable consumer information. Therefore, a rather rapid schedule was devised to not waste efforts if a solution did not appear quickly. znee LnZ0S",0

"RJR Interoffice Memorandum Subject: Highlights Date: April 28, 1992 To: Brenda Hodge From: Robert A. Heckman Prelininary Assessments of Outside Laboratory Methods for Pesticides An unusually, large nunber of analytical methods were submitted to the CORESTA Pesticide Sub-Group for consideration at its recent meeting (meeting report to follow). Several of these methods were practiced by several menbers of my roup and myself in the months and weeks prior to the meeting which convened in famburg, Germany on April 20th. Sone of our findings, which were diplomatically disclosed at the meeting, are summarized below. §C Method for MH-30. Contributed by J. K. Renaud of Philip Morris Europe. ‘This method entails a two-hr extraction of tobacco with 2N HCI containing a derivitizable internal standard {formerly barbital, but revised to G-methyluracil), followed by neutralization and in situ methylation with dimethyl sulfate. Not having access to barbital, I synthesized and Characterized the 0,N-dimethy] derivative of HH-30 and used it as external standard for GC analysis using NPD as prescribed. The recovery of MH-30 using ‘this approach a derivitizable internal standard was 37%. Other concerns are the acute toxicity of dimethyl sulfate, relegation to use of a NPD detector, and responsiveness of the method to bound’residues of MH-30 that are cnown to exist. HPLC Method for HH-30. Contributed by G. Lionetti of the Italian Honopoly. This method involves a 2N HC) extraction of tobacco, followed by passage of the extract through C-18 and analysis by HPLC using a C-18 column.

"Platelet Thrombospondin Forms a Trimolecular Complex with Plasminogen and Histidine-rich Glycoprotein Roy L. Silverstein, Lawrence L. K. Leung, Peter C. Harpel, and Ralph L. Nachman Department of Medicine, Division of Hematlogy-Oncology, and the Specialized Center of Research in Thrombosis, The New York HosplCornell Medical Center, New York 10021 Abstract Torombospondin (TSP), a multifunctional a-granule glycopro- tein of human platelets binds fibrinogen, fibronectin, heparin, histidine-rich glycoprotein (HIRGP), and plasminogen (Pig), and thus, may play an important role in regulating thrombotic Influences a vessel surfaces. In this study we have demonstrated that purified human platclt TSP formed atrimolecular complex with human Pig and HRGP. Complex formation was detected by a specific binding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) which demonstrated simultaneous binding of fuid- phase Plg and HRGP to TSP adsorbed to microttration wells. While neither ligand inhibited complex formation of the other with TSP, 10 mM eamino-r-caproie acid selectively blocked incorporation of Pig into the complex, suggesting that TSP contains independent binding sites for Plg and HIRGP. Com parable extent of trimolecular complex formation was also detected when TSP monomer was substituted for whole TSP inthe ELISA. HIRGP covalently crosslinked to Sepharose 4B simultaneously bound both ""S-TSP and ""1-Pig, confieming teimolecular complex formation, Rocket immunoelectrophoresis ‘of mixtures of the purified radiolabeled proteins into anti-Pig containing agarose also confirmed trimolecular complex for- tation, The TSP-HRGP-Pig complex hound 2 similar amount of heparin as the TSP-HRGP complex, demonstrating that the HIRGP within the trimolecular complex maintained functional capability. Similarly, using a Muorometsie plasmin substrate, the trimoleclar complex was shown tobe an effective substrate for tissue plasminogen activator. Significant amounts of plasmin were generated from the TSP-HRGP-Pig complex (cquivalent to that from the TSP-Plg complex), but the rate of plasmin aeneration from the trimolecular complex was greater than from the bimolecular complex, suegesting an important inter- action of HRGP with Plg when both are complexed to TSP. ‘The macromolecular assembly of these three proteins on celular surfaces, such a5 the platelet, may serve important regulatory functions, both prothrombotic at sites of active fibrin deposition and proteolytic ln noafibriaontaning miero- ‘environments.

It is also a product of endothelial cells (6, 7), fibroblasts (@), and monocytes (9), and isa constituent ofthe extracellular ‘matrix (8). TSP is @ multifunctional molecule that appears to be organized, like fibronectin (10), into diserete functional domains (11-13), The endogenous lectin of human platelets is TSP (14, 15) and anti-TSP Fab partially inhibits platelet aggregation (16), suggesting an important role in platelet function. Among other known functions of TSP are the ability to bind specifically with heparin (1, 11), fibrinogen (17), fibronectin (17, 18), and type V collagen (19), and thus, perhaps play a role in extracellular matrix organization, cell- cell and cali:matsix communication, and modulation of he- mostasis. Recently we have shown that there is a high affinity interaction of TSP with histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRGP) (20) and with plasminogen (Pig) (21). HRGP, an a2-elycopro- {ein of human plasma (22), i also found in platelet a-granles and is seereted upon platelet activation (23). It isa protein of ‘multiple functions, including metal binding and perhaps trans- port (24), immunoregulation (25), and modulation of hemo- stasis, HRGP binds heparin sith bigh affinity and neutralizes its anticoagulant effect (26, 27); it also binds Plg via that protein's high affinity Wysine-binding site (LBS) (28) and thus may serve as a physiological counterpart tothe antifibrinlytic amino acids. The TSP-HRGP complex retains the heparin binding and neutralizing function of HRGP (20), and the ‘TSP-Plg interaction, which is also mediated via the Plg LBS, interferes with the ability of tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) to activate Plg (21) on a fibrin clot. In this paper, we report that TSP can form a trimolecular complex with HRGP. ‘and Pig and thatthe HGP and Pig within the macromolecular ‘complex retain functional capability. Such functional macro- ‘molecular complexes, when assembled on platelet as well as ‘other cellular surfaces, may modulate thrombotic as well as fibrinolytic events. Methods. ‘Materials.

"‘TANAPOLIS STAR, Jack Anderson PAGE 9 Ignoring smoking warnings Washington — The tobacco com- panies’ long. deliberate campaign to undereut government warnings on the hazards of cigarette smoking has been astonishingly successful, ac- cording to internal industry ‘doc- uments that have been suppressed by court order. ‘The Federal Trade Commission recently reported that the health ‘waming on every pack of cigarettes is ineffective, and the industry's own studies support this conclusion, But 2 federal judge acceded to the tobac- co companies’ request that doc- uments subpoenaed by the FTC be locked up. The section of the agen cey's report that discusses the doc- uments has also been withheld from the public. My associate Tony Capaccio has seen the suppressed material. One document in particular illustrates just how ineffective the govern: ment’s many warnings about ciga- Fettes have been. It is a 1977 survey by the firm of Yankelovich, Skelly and White for the Brown & Wiliam ‘son Tobaceo Corp. Here are some of its findings: * NEARLY ONE-FOURTH of the nation’s cigarette smokers do not believe that smokers die younger than non-smokers. Twenty-two percent of the gen- ‘eral population, including 32 percent of smokers, were not aware that ‘smoking increases the risk of any type of cancer. ‘* Twenty-three percent of the population (and 38 percent of smok- fers) believed the statement, “They. still haven't proven that smoking. ‘causes lung cancer.” * Thirty-eight percent of the population (and nearly half the T smokers) did not know that smoking increases the risk of heart disease. * A particularly reprehensible feature of the cigarette companies"" ‘multimilliondollar advertising cam- Paigns has been their accent on youth — devising means to hook ‘young people on the smoking habit For example, a 1975 ad plan pre- Many still do not believe that smokers die younger than non-smokers. pared for Brown & Williamson sug- ested these ways to attract “start- ers” to smoke Viceroy cigarettes, “Present the cigarette as one of the few initiations into the adult world.” * “TO THE BEST of your abili- ty, relate the cigarette to ‘pot,’ wine, beer, sex, etc.” = “Don't communicate health or health related points.” The word “Don’t was underlined for empha- sis ‘The suppressed section of the FTC report has this to add: “B&W documents show that it translated the advice on how to attract ‘start. ers"" into an advertising campaign featuring young adults in situations that the vast'majority of young People probably would experience and in situations demonstrating adherence to a ‘free and easy, hedonistic lifetyle."""" Another example of the cigarette makers’ deliberate targeting of young people is his quote from the “Through the association of Salem and its brand styles with emulatable personalities that are ‘compatible with the aspirations and styles of contemporary young adults. this important target seg. ment will be attracted to the brand. * EXECUTIVE MEMO — A former Senate aide who was accused of offering classified information to Is- Faeli officials in 1978 has been a consultant to the Defense Depart- ment and is in line for a sensitive, full-time position at the Pentagon, He is Stephen Bryen, who was work: ing for the Foreign Relations Com mittee when the charges were made A former lobbyist for the National Association of Arab-Americans swore in an affidavit that he over- heard Bryen, in Washington's Mad- ison Hotel, offer Israeli officials document ‘on Arab military bases Bryen denied any wrongdoing, and was cleared by the FBI. He is now'a consultant to Richard Perle, acting assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs. Perle said the 1978 charges were “a scahe dalous attack initiated by a pro. fessional lobbying organization 's White House budget-cutters ap parently want to dismantle the anti- Poverty Community Services Agen- cy, despite the nomination of a new CSA assistant chief.

To evaluate the importance of this recycling. pathway in greater detail, we examined the internali- zation and reveling of cell surface glycoproteins on EL-4 cells, a murine T-cell lymphoma, using sialic acids as covalent markers. Sialic acids were removed from the surface of living cells by exhaustive treatment with Vibrio cholerae sialidase at 4 °C and shown to be derived primarily from glycoproteins (93%), with only. ‘4 small amount from glycolipids (7%). Cells were r cultured at 37 °C over time and monitored for the resialylation of the cell surface using a sensitive high pressure liquid chromatography adaptation of the thio- barbituric acid assay for sialic acids. The return of sialic acid to the cell surface was found to be contingent ‘upon de novo protein synthesis indicating that the bulk of plasma membrane sialogiycoconjugates do not re- eycle to an endogenous sialyltransferase-containing compartment for oligosaccharide reprocessing. Iden~ tical results were found for K562 cells, a human eryth roleukemia cell lin ‘The movement of specific glycoproteins was followed using the enzyme rat liver a2~GGald1-4GIeNAc sialyl- transferase together with CMP-[*H)NewAc as an im- bermeant probe of the cell surface, Surface sialogly- coproteins were internalized slowly, a process unal- fected by eyeloheximide treatment. Only a few of tese internalized glycoproteins were found to return to a trans-Golgi compartment followed by reeyeling to the cell surface. Taken together, these data indicate that the majority of replacement of sialic acids on the cell surface is due to de novo synthesis of glycoproteins and that only a small number of glycoproteins recycle through a trans-Golgi compartment.

Partment through which newly synthesized as well as inter- ‘alized proteins pass (reviewed in Farquhar, 1985; Fishman ‘and Fine, 1987; Griffith ca, 1986; Herzog, 1961; Romagnoli and Herzog, 1987; van Douts vt al, 1988; Yamashiro etl. 1984). ‘The internalization ot plasma membrane glycoproteins and their subsequent return zo the cell sueface has beon observed in many laboratories (reviewed in Brown eta, 1989; Fishman ‘and Cook, 1986). At present, both the mechanisms which induce the internalization of cell surface glycoproteins and the intracellular pathways they may take are unclear. For example, the igand-induced endocytosis of cell surface recep. tors has been shown to include the return of some of these 78 to the cell suciace atter deposition of ligand in an intracellular compar ment (reviewed in Goldstein et a, 1985). However, binding ut specific ligand may not be the sole signal for internalization, Endocytosis of receptors for trans- ferrin, low density lipoprotein, «,-macroglobaiin, T-lympho. exte antigens (T3/Ter), and asialoglycoproteins has been demonstrated to occur in the absence of corresponding ligand. (Ajioka and Kaplan, 1985: Anderson et al, 1982; Kaplan and Keogh, 1981; Krangel, 1951; Schwartz et al, 1984; Watts, 1985). The specific itinerary followed by an internalized recep. tors another complexity. asa given reeeptor may follow more than one intracellular puciway (Fishman and Cook, 1986; Stein and Sussman, 1956). The transport of internalized molecules to the Goigi cisternae has been demonstrated for transferrin receptor, and total cellular glycoproteins, resulting in biochemical reprocessing of their associated oligosacchas ides (Regoecei et a 1954: Snider and Rogers, 1985, 1986), ‘The question then arises as so whither all cell surface glyco. proteins are similarly intemalized or whether internalization ‘and oligosaccharide reprocessing includes only a selected pop- ulation, We designed experiments to elaborate on three aspects of cell surface glycoprotein movement. First, to what extent is a Golgi-mediated reprocessiny pathway utilized hy the cell to maintain steady-state levels of cell surface sialylation? Sec. ‘ond, to what degree is internalization selective? Third, can a functional correlation be drawn between those glycoproteins Which are reeyeled and those which remain resident on the cell surface? Sialic acids are added in the Golgi cisternae at a late stage of glycoprotein processing (Kornfeld and Kornfeld, 1985). In our studies, sialic acids were used as a covalent marker by which the movement of cell surtace glyeoproteing could be traced, We used two novel techniques to assess the silylation state of the cell surface anc of individual glycoproteins on the plasma membrane: 1) to:il cell surface sialie acid was quan. 16316 50576001",6

"RIR Inter-office Memorandum Subject: Administrative Costs of Air Quality Control #*! December 12, 1974 Program To: James S. Dowdell From: y, E, Miller, Jr. As we agreed at our meeting with Messrs. Sherrill, Speer and McGrane on December 9, I am forwarding to you our past and current costs of administering RJRT's Air Quality Control Program. 1. Cost of Initial Source Registration State and County Air Quality Regulations require that all sources of emissions to atmosphere be identified and registered. This involved testing gaoh of the Company's stacks or emission points (approximately 600) and submitting data on the related process as well as the emissions. This emission inventory and registration will be com- pleted around the first of the year, at a total cost of approximately $300,000. The Forsyth County Environmental Affairs Department has requested additional information which they say is necessary to complete their files to satisfy E.P.A. require- ments. It would cost approximately $25,000 to compile this additional information which includes complete and detailed flow diagrams of every Company process. We feel that the previously submitted data is sufficient for the Agency's purposes, and that anything further will be a waste of time and money as well as release of much proprietary type information. 2. Annual Monitoring and Administrative Costs For the last several years, RJRT has averaged spending $200,000 per year for air quality monitor- ing, data handling, program administration and preliminary studies. This does not include any costs directly related to individual air quality projects such as design and project management, or any of the capital expenditures on the projects. I anticipate that we will continue spending between $150,000 and $200,000 per year on air quality monitoring and administration. A great deal of this effort will be necessary to provide information to the County for permits required for each process or source.addition or modification. This information must be supplied on a very comprehensive and detailed -1- ant FORM 2422-Rev. 2/70 661 0005",0
"WHAT OTHERS ARE SAYING ABOUT THE TOBACCO INSTITUTE’S YOUTH INITIATIVES The crities should let the tobacco industry off the hook on this one. Any campaign to keep kids trom smoking, no matter who conducts it, should be applauded. What the anti-smoking forces don't seem to realize is that it's possible to serve the Public's interests as well as those of the tobacco industry.” USA Today (12/14/90) "" Thave not hesitated to disagree with The Tobacco Institute on many issues, but your program of discouraging teenagers from smoking is to be applauded.” The Honorable Paul Simon US. Senator from Mlinois Now {tobacco companies] tind themselves criticized for volunteering proposals that would restrict their own freedom to do business, at some cost to Profits. In this case, the industry is behaving in a way that warrants praise, not condemnation."" Chicago Tribune (12/26/90) “Tam pleased with The Tobacco Institute's etforts to be responsible corporate citizens.” The Honorable Gwen Margolis President, Florida State Senate "" As the parent of three, I commend your efforts in this regard.” The Honorable T.K. Wetherell Speaker, Florida House of Representatives * What is needed is not more laws, but more education, The tobacco industry's booklet is one step on a forced march in that direction, It does offer some sensible advice for parents who dare to ty talking to their kids.” Cleveland Plain Dealer (12/16/90) "" Industry organizations should consider {their] own standards for accomplishing informational re-vonsibilities in an acceptable manner. Examples of successful programs include ... the recently implemented Tobacco Institute program aimed at encouraging minors not to smoke.” The Honorable Terry Bruce USS. Congressman from Illinois -» It's czrainly good to see the industry starting to do something about deterring [youths from smoking], whatever the motive.” Ganner Westchester Newspapers (12/17/90) ""We applaud The Tobacco Institute's program as a valuable first step towards the education of our youth to the issues involved in tobacco use.""

A Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Study Jerry F. Whidby and Jeffrey 1. Seeman* Philip Morris Research Center, P., Box 26585, Richmond, Virginia 23261 Received July 29, 1975 Radiofrequency itradiation of the N-methyl zroup in nicotine st pD values of 11.0,5.0, and 08 caused nuclear Overhauser enhancersen's (NOE) of the pyridyl protons and the C-2’ and C-5"" protons on the pyrrolidine ring. However, irradiation of the N-methyl group at 2.13 ppm of nicotine in trifluoroacetic acid solution (TFA) did not cause an NOE on the pyridyl protons but rater on the C.2"" and C-8'9 protons. In TFA, the ate of deprotona (of nicotinium diacid salts is slow compared to the NMR time scale, and the peak at 3.13 ppm is attributed tothe ricotinivi salt a whieh the N-methyl group is trans to the pyridine ring. A second singlet at 282 pom isatteibuted to the nicotinium salt in which the V-methyl group is cia ta the pyridine cing, These assignments were established bby NMR studies in mistures of TFA-TF A-d, These resulta are interpreted in term of nizeogen protonationdepro- tonation-pyramidal inversion equilibria and the complexities of NOE studies on configurationally mobile systems. ‘The rates of inversion and proton relaxation are considered. It is estimated that nicotine-eee base exists with its ‘Nemethyl group preferentially (90.9 + 0.9%) trans to the pyridine ring by gas-phase kinetic quenching experiments, ‘The configuration! of nicotine and nicotine acid salts has been a topic of concern for many years."" Nicotine structural analysis indicates two unknown features: the orientation of the N-methyl group and the relative position of the pyridine and pyrrolidine rings. Experimental determination of these two structural parameters is complicated by the likelihood of ow enerzy barriers to change."" We now report the cesults of ‘our studies which show that the preferred (>30%) conti ration of the N-methyl group in nicotine is 1” (R) (ie, trans to the pyridine ring) under a variety of experimental condi- tions. Recently, Chynoweth, Ternai, Simeral, and MacielS con- cluded on the basis of their NMR studies of nicatine in CDCly land Ds0 “that the N-mathyl group is preferentially on the ‘same side of the pyrrolidine ring a8 the pyridine ring”. That conclusion’ contrasted with perturbative configuration in- teraction calculations performed by Pullman, Courriere, and Coubeils,7* which indicated that 1 (see Scheme I) was ap, proximately 4 kcal/mol more stable than 2.1! Other investi gators? based their configurational assignments on (1) steric evaluations using space-filling models or (2) demethylation studies of nicotine N’-oxide. Any conclusion based on these latter two criteria meets with severe criticism. Finally, Koo and Kira® have roported the x-ray analysis ofa crystal of ni= ‘cotine dihydriodide in which the N-methyl group was in a trana configuration with respect to the pyridine ring (ef. 3). However, the crystalline sample was undoubtedly prepared under conditions in which the equilibria shown in Scheme I were operative, and itis theoretically possible that a minor component, or one of a number of components, crystallized. In addition, conclusions based on x-ray data of a solid cannot necessarily be applied to the conformation or configuration, of the same molecule in solution, especially if protonation deprotonation reactions are occurring in solution.'* ~ > 1000769824",6

We've learned that urban air pollution has very itl if any influence ‘on death rates from lung ‘cancer. On the other hand, occupational exposure to asbestos dusts does inerease the risk of lung cancer.” ‘The study demonstrated the great importance of abnormal bleeding as a warning signal for eancer ofthe uterus. “Abs especially important for women to have a medical examination and a Pap {estat least once a year. “This is part of what we mean by cancer prevention.” Dr. Shields said, “We know that if we ‘can detect this form of cancer early we ‘ean save these women.” Headded, “For many years there was a debate as. to whether tuberculosis increase or decreases the risk of lung ‘cancer.

McClellan Inhalation Toxicology Research Intute, Lovelace Biomedical and Environmental Research Insite, P. 0. Box $890, Albugeergue, New Mexico 6718S INTRODUCTION ‘The health effects of diesel exhaust (DE) have been 2 focus of intensive research during the last decade. Increased use of diesel engines in light-duty passenger ears and vans stimulated this research, These vehicles are used ‘extensively in populated areas snd thus could increase the exposure of urban ""residents to DE. Diesel engine-powered vehicles emit moce oxides of nitrogen end some 30 {0 100 times more panicles than do gatoline engines with contemporary ‘emission-control devices. The small size of diesel exhaust particles (DEP) ‘makes them readily respirable, which raises concem for their health effets, As early as 1955, Ketin etal (1) evalusted the chemical composition of diesel ‘exhaust particle extracts (DEPE) and demonstrated their carcinogenicity in rmouse-skin-painting studies. However, litle addtional research was done on DE until the mid-1970s, when advances in biology provided improved methods such as the Ames Salmonella typhimurium aesay (2) for detecting mutagenicity and, potentially, careinogeniity. In 1977 the US Environmental Protection Ageney issued a precautionary notice (3) reporting thet DEPE were mutagenic in bacterial assays. These findings were subsequently published by Huisingh et al (4). This observed mutagenicity wiggered a major research effort on the health effects of DE. The results of this research have been the topic of several symposia and reviews (5-11), and are briefly reviewed in this ancl.

"The Effects of Smoking Policy on Indoor Air Quality ' and Sick Building Syndrome in 18 Air-Conditioned Offices A. Hedge WA, Erickson ABSTRACT A study ofthe effets of smoking policy on indoor air qual- ‘iy and sick building syndrome symptoms among 3,155 workers in I8 private sector air-conditioned office buildings is described. Five smoking policies were investigated: smoking prohibited, “smoking restricted to rooms with local filtration, smoking res- tricted to rooms with no local air treatment, smoking restricted {0 rooms with separate ventilation, and smoking restricted to the open-plan cubicle workstations and enclosed offices. Levels of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, respirable particulates, formaldehyde, ultraviolet particulate mass, nicotine, air tem perature, and relative humidity were measured at eight sample sites in each building. Approximately 30 workers at each of the eight somple sites completed an exiensive questionnaire on ‘environmental conditions, sick building syndrome symptoms, {0b satisfaction, job stress, smoking history, and personal ‘details. Indoor air quality measures met the current ASHRAE {92-1989 standard. Comparison of al open-office sites between policies showed no significant differences in levels of carbon ‘monoxide, carbon dixide, formaldehyde, or respirable particu- lates. Levels of ultraviolet particulate mass and relative humid ity were significantly lower in buildings where smoking is prohibited, and ar temperature was significantly higher in these buildings, although on average this was <I°C. Among al bulld- ‘ngs, air temperature was the only physical measure hat was sig- nificantly correlated with SBS symptoms. Smoking policy had ro significant effet on sick buildin syndrome symptoms. INTRODUCTION ‘Tobacco smoking indoors has been identified asa source of ‘a number of indoor air contaminants, especially particulate ‘matter (Hodgson 1989; Van DeWiel etal. 1989) and combustion ‘products (Godish 1990). Burning tobacco releases several thou- ‘sand pollutants into theair, of which about 400 have been quan- tified (US, Surgeon General 1986). Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is an aerosol comprising vapor and particulate phases, both of which contain many organic and inorganic com pounds (Eatough etal. 1988). ETS is a combination of side- stream smoke ($8) from the burning cigarette and exhaled G. Rubin ‘mainstream smoke (MS) from the smoker (Guerin et al. 1987; Reasor 1987). The exposure of nonsmokers to second-hand stoke is termed “passive smoking!” Passive smoking has been linked toa variety of health problems, including ung cancer and ‘cardiovascular disease (OTA 1986; Samet eta. 1987). ‘Throughout the past decade, concerns have grown about the association between indoor air quality AQ) in the work: place and a variety of health complaint, including symptoms of the “sick building” syndrome. The sick building syndrome (SBS) describes a collection of nonspecific symptoms, including eye, nose, and throat irritation, mental fatigue, headaches, nausea, dizziness, and skin irritation, which seem to be linked with occupancy of certain workplaces (WHO 1983; Burge etal. 1987), SBS symptoms are experienced at work but are alleviated ‘when away from work for any period of time. SBS complaints among office workers are thought to be caused by poor IAQ, but substantial empirical evidence suggests that SBS problems arise from the combined effects of a variety of environmental and nonenvironmental risk factors (Hedge 1989; Hedge et al. 1989). ‘Tentative evidence of an association between passive smok- ing and SBS complaints in U.K. offices has been reported (Robertson et al. 1987), but this has not been systematically investigated. Indeed, SBS complaints are more frequent among smokers (Hodgson and Collopy 1989). In recent years, many ‘companies have introduced a smoking-probibited policy, but since up to 30% of workers may be smokers, implementing such 1 policy may not be the most cost-effective alternative. To balance the requirements of nonsmokers and smokers, other ‘companies have implemented spatially restrictive smoking poi- cies, which confine smoking to certain areas of the building. Such polices attempt to minimize any widespread ai pollution {rom cigarette smoking through dilution ventilation, localized filtration, or separate ventilation. ‘This paper summarizes findings from an ongoing research project investigating the effects of diferent smoking polices on IAQ and SBS complaints in air-conditioned private sector office buildings. Results for 18 office buildings using five dffer- ‘ent smoking polices ae described. ‘Alan Hedge and William A.

"AUG 19 '88 12:04 YER NY Ps Legally approved I. Prototypical copy INTRODUCING PREMIER. It's been called the most significant advance in cigarette history. We call it Premier. Because it's the beginning of a whole new era of smoking enjoyment -- cleaner enjoyment than you may have ever thought possible. PREMIER REVOLUTIONIZES SMOKING. Incredible as it sounds, new Premier is the first cigarette you actually smoke by heating tobacco, not burning it. It's a breakthrough that changes the very composition of cigarette smoke -- substantially reducing many of the controversial compounds found in the smoke of tobacco-burning cigarettes. Those that remain include carbon monoxide, but the amount of carbon monoxide is no greater than in the best-selling ""lights."" Quite simply, it's a breakthrough for ‘everyone who smokes. CLEANER SMOKE. CLEANER PLEASURE. From your very first puff, Premier will treat you to a smoother, easier ‘smoke than you've ever experienced. Smoke that feels full but not at all heavy. Smoke that satisfies, yet dissipates almost the moment you exhale. What it all comes down to is a cleaner smoke for you and everyone around you, ONE WEEK WILL CONVINCE YOU. If all this sounds too good to be true, prove it to yourself. Enjoy Premier for a week and discover the new pleasure of cleaner smoking. OSsSe Sa90g THE CLEANER SMOKE.",4

"INTEROFFICE MEMORANDUM AUGUST 31, 1993 TO: HRRC FROM: FRED BEST SUBJECT: CAMEL Light casing ingredient optimization screening study. Request for approval to use higher than normal burley casing levels for sensory evaluation. A. Background - The Flavor Division would like to know the optimum levels of HFCS (high fructose corn syrup), cocoa and licorice to use in burley casing to obtain reduced harshness and more smoothness while maintaining or enhancing tobacco taste. In other words provide a more acceptable cigarette to the franchise. Doubts have been raised recently as to the need for licorice and cocoa in casing. Also, although HFCS is being tested on many products because it provides economic advantages, optimum use levels have not been determined. This current proposal is a screening study with 4 parts (high, medium and low levels of all 3 ingredients and a CAMEL Light control) to determine if sensory panels can distinguish between different casing levels. If they can, a large casing optimization study will be conducted. B. Human Participants - are needed because smoker preference is the only valid method of evaluation. €. Scientific Affairs Review - All 3 ingredients are commonly used in current casings at lower levels. Scientific Affairs xequested that we get Ames testing on the product with the highest levels of casing ingredients. This was done and no difference was found between the test product with high casing levels and a CAMEL Light control (see Attachment 1 for AMES report). Scientific Affairs has cleared these products for sensory testing pending HRRC approval. A copy of the Scientific Affairs recommendation is attached (see attachment 2). D. Product Description - Three test products made in CAMEL Light configuration and a CAMEL Light control will be used. Since endogenous sugar levels in flue-cured and Turkish tobaccos vary significantly and make sugar additions to final blend difficult to measure, this study is designed to evaluate levels applied to the burley prior to final blending. sugar additions to final blend were calculated. Since there is no endogenous cocoa or licorice in tobacco, measured levels on final blend were considered addition’ levels.

Bob Stone requests mail and phone calls to the retailers to urge their attendance at this meeting. Mesa, Ariz, - The city council voted on 12/20 to amend the city’s smoking ban. The ordinance allows smoking in bars and restaurant bar areas. Restaurants can get a hardship variance if they can prove a.15 percent loss over a four month period. Businesses can also have a separate outdoor smoking arca and hotels can allow smoking in private, rented ‘conference rooms. Opponents of the smoking ban filed sufficient signature to force either modification of the ban or a special election on the issue. Although 5 of the 7 council ‘members said they supported a special election, the council decided to amend rather than call for an election. The city clerk said that an election was still possible, but not likely. The amended language will go into effect 30 days from passage. RJR0000000507062775 70017 7526 gezy 1087S",2

"‘Thrombosis and Haemostasis ~ © F K. Schattauer Verkagsgesellschaft mbH (Stutigart) 67 (4) 428-433 (1992) Bacterial Expression of Biologically Active High Molecular Weight Kininogen Light Chain Satya P. Kunapuli, Raul A. DeLa Cadena, and Robert W. Colman From the Thrombosis Research Center, Tomple University Schoo! of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA igh molecular weight kininogen (HK), a single chain plasma glycoprotein, serves asa cofactor inthe contact system of| blood coagulation. After cleavage by human plasma kallikrein, the nonapeptide bradykinin is released. The HK light chain (LC) contains coagulant activity, which requires both the ability to bind ‘the contact system 2ymogens, prekallikrein and factor Xl, and the ability toi tively charged surfaces. Since bacterial expression m uccessful if carbohydrate was required for activity, we evaluated that possibility by incubating plasma HK with endoghyvosyase F Although the procedute removed tecable N-linked carbohydrate, no change in specific activity ‘carted. We then developed a bacterial expression system (0 produce recombinant HK LC. The DNA coding for the HK LC ‘was prepared by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), digested with restriction enzymes EcoRI and Put, and introduced into the ‘bacterial expression vector pKK223-3. E.colt harboring this recombinant plasmid (pSK1) expressed HK LC upon induction with isopropytthiogaactoside (IPTG). The recombinant protein 27 kDa), when transferred onto a PVDF membrane, was recog: nized by monospecific polyclonal anti-HK LC-antibodies. The fecombinant HK LC was purified by heparin agarose atfinity chromatography to homogeneity and found to have a specific activity of 28 coagulant units per me protein, similar to the specific activity of the LC derived by proteolytic digestion of hhumian plasmia HK. We conclude: 1) The HK LC synthesized in bacteria is biologically active, and 2) the 40% carbohydrate content of the HIK LC is not require for its cofactor activity Introductory Statement Normal human plasma contains two different forms of kinino- ens ~ low molecular weight kininogen (LK) and high molecular weight kininogen (HK) derived from a single gene by differential splicing (1). Toth kininogens are single chain glycoproteins containing the identical amino terminal heavy chain, and bradyki nin, but unigue earhoxyterminal light chains. ‘The plasma con- ceniration of HK i 70-90 yt and of LK is 200-260 pesmi (2-4). Both prekalikrein (PK) and factor XI (FX1) circulate in plasma complexed to HK (5-7). In plasma, kallikrein cleaves both HK and LK and releases bradykinin, a potent vasodilator, The remsining portion of the kininogens are held together by a Single disulfide bond between the heavy chain (M, 62,000) and the light chain of LK (4, 4,000) or the light chain of HK (M, 56,000) “The S6 kDa light chain of the HK (LC 1) is further cleaved to a 445 kDaalight chain (LC 2) by kallikrein. The heavy chain contains ‘qsteine protease inhibitory domains, while the LC of HK coninins the anionic surface binding domain, the region binding the 2ymogens, PK and FXI (8-10) and a heparin binding site. The HK LC binds to surfaces and the attached PK is thereby ~Gorponiece 1: De Say F.

PK accessible to active factor XII (factor Xta) (12-14). Factor Xila, generated by reciprocal activation of prckalikrein and factor XU, initiates the itrinsc Blood coagulation pathway (15) by converting FXI to factor Xta. Kallikrein triggers the inflam: matory pathway by releasing bradykinin from HK. Patients with kininogen deficieney of HK alone (Flaujac case (16) and Fitz {gerald case (17)] oF of both FIK and LK (Williams case (18) show defective blood clotting in vitro which ean be corrected by the ‘addition of purified HK. A monoclonal antibody, CIICI, developed against the HK LC in our laboratory has been shown to inhibit the coagulant activity ofthe HK (19) by blocking essential residues required for the binding of HK to negatively charged surfaces (20). However, attempis to characterize the domains for anionic surface binding and to identify the mAb epitope have been limited by the laborious purification and low yield of the alkylated light chain of HK and the need to perform extensive proteolytic modifications. Moreover, although HK contains 40% ‘ofits mass as eorbohydrate, the funtion ofthese side chins i currently unknown. Hence, we adopted the recombinant DNA, approach to produce light chain of HK to study steeture-function relationships.

In cells expressing only #1, homodimers and -tcimers of HI are formed. In contrast, when expressed in 373 cells without Ht, H2 is synthesized as its 43-kDa precursor, bearing high-mannose ‘oligosaccharides, but israpldly degraded, When HI and H2.are ‘coexpressed inthe same cell the Ht polypeptide “rescues” the 2 polypeptide; H2 is processed to its characteristic S0-kDa ‘mature form and is transported to the surface. We conclude that the human ASGP-R is a moltichain beterooligomer, probably a trimer of HI molecules in noncovalent association with one, two, or three H2 molecules, and that the two polypeptides normally interact early in biosynthesis. ‘The hepatocyte asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGP-R) binds with high-affinity serum glycoproteins bearing multiple ter- minal galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine residues. It has served as a model for many of the events of receplor- mediated endocytosis, such as ligand binding, receptor— ligand dissociation and sorting, and recycling ofthe receptor to the cell surface (1-3). The human ASGP-R, purified from liver or the hepatoma cell line HepG2, was thought to be composed only of a single 46-kDa polypeptide, designated HL. However, by cDNA cloning (4, 5) and direct identfica- tion (6), second and less abundant human ASGP-R molec- ‘lar species, H2 (49-50 kDa), has been characterized. Are these two human ASGP-R polypeptides independent recep- tors with different functions and specificities, or do they only together comprise a functional ASGI McPhaul and Berg (7) demonstrated that Expression of both rat ASGP-R cDNAs, rat hepatic lectin (RHL)-1 and RHL-2/-3, is required to form a functional ASGP-R in rat HTC cells, one that can internalize and accumulate in lysosomes fluorescent-labeled asialoorosomucoid (ASOR). ‘Sawyer et al. (8) showed that plasma membrane RHL-1 and RHL-2/-3 peptides do interact noncovalently. In contrast, on the basis of chemical crosslinking and galactose affinity ‘chromatography studies, Drickamer and his colleagues ‘cluded that the at ASGP-R polypeptides associate only into distinct homooligomers of RHL-1 or RHL-2/-3 (9). In par ticular, they could not chemically cross-link RL-1 with “The polation costs ofthis article were defrayed in part by page charge ‘payment, Thivarile must therefor be hereby masked"" aoveriemen?” accordance with 18 U.S.C. 41734 Solely to indicate this fact. uss RHL-2/3, but they were able o crosslink each respective peptide to isel to form homooligomers ©). ‘Using chemical cross-linking and antibody-induced degra- ation protocols, we showed that, in HepG2 els, Hl and H2 form a heterooligomer (10). Here we examine the fate ofthe individual polypeptides in singly transfected mouse NIH 3T3 cells or in 313 cells that express both human ASGP-R polypeptides. We propose a model ofthe ASGP-R structure in which a “core” trimer of HI molecules can interact with ‘one, two, of three H2 molecules. Although the exact stoi chiometry of the interactions between H1 and H2 is stl tunknown, itis clear that these polypeptides must interact carly in biosynthesis to assemble a functional ASGP-R. MATERIALS AND METHODS Construction of pDOL-ASGP-R. All DNA manipulations involved standard techniques (1). The retroviral expression vector pDO-L was kindly provided by A. Korman, C. Cepko, and RC. Mulgan of he Whitehead Institute (12). The entre coding regions of Hl and H2 were excised from the plasmids pSAL-and pSA2 (4, §) and ligated into the Bamdil site of PDO-L via Bg! I and BamEt inkers, respectively. Introduction of ASGP-R Polypeptides into NIH 373 Cells. ‘Tea micrograms of pDOL-H1, pDOL-H2, or pDOL. without insert DNA was used to transform y-2 cells (12, 13) as described by Deitcher eal. (14). The transient viral super natant was sed to infect NIH 3T3 cell, which were selected for GAs resistance and cloned as described (12, 14).

Model simulations that optimized for the appearance of cotinine in plasma estimated Kyc and Kp to be 75.8 and 24.3 hr“*, respectively.

To validate the model's ability 10 predict tissue kinetics of nicotine, 21 male SD rats were administered 0.1 mg/ke (S)-I5- HiJnicotine intraarterially. At seven time points following treatment, 3 rats were euthanized and tissues were removed and analyzed for nicotine. Model-predicted nicotine tissue kinetics were in agreement with those determined experi- mentally in muscle, liver, skin, fat, and kidney, The brain, heact, and lung exhibited nonlinear nicotine elimination, sag ‘esting that saturable nicotinic binding sites may be important in nicotine disposition in these organs. Inclusion of saturable receptor binding expressions in the mathematical description of these compartments resulted in better agreement with the experimental data, The Baa, and Ko estimated by model sim- ulations for these tissues were brain, 0.009 and 0.125 lung, 0.039 and 2.0; and heart, 0.039 nmol/tissue and 0.12 ns, respectively.

Tobacco use represents the most substantial exposure 10 nicotine. Surveys by the Centers for Disease ‘Control indicate that 26.5% ofthe adult US population are smokers (CDC, 1987). This extensive use of tobacco in our society has generated concern over the potential health risks associated with nicotine (DHHS, 1989). Accurately pre- dicting nicotine uptake and disposition in humans isa nec- essary step in assessing the potential adverse health effects of nicotine. Although plasma pharmacokinetics have been extensively documented in animals(Kyerematen eta. 1982, 1987, 1988: Adir tal, 1976; Rotenberg et al. 1980) and ‘humans (Rosenberg ea, 1980; Scherer eral, 1988; Kyee ematen «al, 1990), the relationship between plasmia con- centrations, tissue concentrations, and pharmacologic or toxicologc effects are not well understood, The principal pharmacologic actions of nicotine are me- ated through central and peripheral nicotinic receptors (Su, 1982; Lippielo and Fernandes, 1986).

This gpl20-stimilated PKC response was blocked ‘by specific PKC inhibitors, a monoclonal antibody to PKC, and a monoclonal antibody directed against the murine T¢ snslog, L3T4. Tt is suggested that the gpl20 interaction with the nuclear trophic factor-PKC system may impair ' normal gene expression, and thus result in the clinical symptoms associated ‘AIDS infection, = 10% xacense reer, tos Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is considered to be the causative agent in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and the viral envelope protein, gpl20, is thought to facilitate viral entry into cells by binding to the surface antigen, T4 (CD4). The T4 antigen has been localized to both lymphocytes and the hippocampus in the brain (1,2). It has been suggested that the pathology associated with HIV is not a direct consequence of viral infection, but rather a result of interaction of gpi20 with T4 receptor sites (34), Interestingly, there is considerable sequence homology between ‘vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and gpi20, (1,2,5) and it has been proposed that VIP and gp120 compete for the same T4 binding sit + (1,2,5,6). Receptors for VIP have been localized to the plasma membrane of lymphocytes (7) and areas within the hippocampus (8), both of which are impaired in AIDS patients. Substantial literature now demonstrates both the presence of receptors for VIP (9) and the enzyme protein kinase C (PKC) in nuclei from a variety of tissues (10-15). ‘The nuclear localization of PKC has been substantiated both immunochemically and biochemically (16,17) and this nuclear poot displays a higher calcium requirement for optimal activation.

"CAmerican Heat. Journal September, 1980, Volume 100, Number 3 Editorial ‘Smoking and coronary heart disease: what are we to believe? Carl C. Seltzer, PhD? Cambridge, Mess. ‘Two recent events have raised serious questions ‘as to what we are to believe about the conven- tional view that cigarette smoking is a cause of coronary heart disease (CHD). Interpretation of ex-smoker: ‘The first event relates to the interpretation of ex-smoker data indicating that CHD mortality rates of persons who stopped smoking are substantially lower than those of persons who continued smoking. The interpretation given to these data is that smoking cessation directly results in the reduction of risk of heart disease mortality. The most commonly cited investiga tions in support of this line of thinking are the observational studies of Doll and Hill's British doctors Hammond's American men and wom- en,’ Kahe's U.S. veterans,’ and the Framingham Study.’ Underlying this alleged CHD benefit, however, is the assumption that ex-smokers are a representative sample of smokers, except in 20 far as they have stopped smoking. But the proof of the validity of this assumption has not been forthcoming. This is a crucial point in the comparison of the CHD outcomes in the two smoking groups. For, if the assumption of repre- sentativeness is invalid and significant baseline ferences are observed between ex-smokers and samokers for relevant factors, then the possibility Recs fa ubicton 2p 1,199, Regrnt meets: Caf €. Sekar, PRD. Harvard Usiety, 11 ‘Deut Roe Combe, Mas 28, ‘Hacer Senior Ravech Ameit, Harvard ivi. exists that the mortality comparison of ex-smok- ‘ers and continuing smokers is biased. For the first time in a very large series of subjects according to race and sex, we observed the proper baseline for the determination of whether or not ex-smokers were a representative ‘sample of smokers.” This baseline involved the study of the CHD-related characteristics of ex- smokers before they stopped smoking and their ‘comparison with those of persistent smokers. The results of this study are briefly reviewed below. Using the longitudinal records from the Kaiser- Permanente multiphasic health check-ups, the study compared 25 CHD-related characteristics of ex-smokers before they stopped smoking with ‘those of persistent smokers and nonsmokers. A total of more than 25,000 subjects, white men and women, black men and women, with three or more consecutive health check-ups formed the basis of the analysis. For the criteria of the classification ofthe subject, the designated “in- dex examination,” and the list of CHD-related characteristic, the reader is referred to the publi- cation? The minimum of three or more examina- tions was used in order to insure a rigorous classification of the smoking categories. Thus, examokers (peristent quitters) were subjects who had at least one examination at which they reported both a current and past history of Cigarette smoking, followed by at least two exam- {nations in which they reported complete cessa- tion of smoking. The CHD-related characteristics fell into arbitrary categories: cardiovascular manifestations (blood pressure, hypertension, American Heart Journal 278 MASTER-SPP 002015 11063829",6

Received 6 July 1989/Accepted 1 October 1989 Fischer rat fibroblasts, naturally resistant to killing by the fibrotropic strain of minute virus of mice Lpacvovirus MVM(p)], became sensitive to MVM when transformed by polyomay rus. This sensitization did ‘nat involve an inerease in the pereentage of cells which synthesized viral capsid antigens or in the percentage Of cells which produced infectious virus. The addition of anti-MVM antiserum to the growth medium of ‘MVMGinfected cells had only a small effect on theic survival rates, indicating that the majority of the killing ifec of MVM occurs in a single cycle of infection, The data indicate that cell killing by MVM is independent ‘of infectious virus production and thus support the notion that the preferential cytolytic effect is affected by ‘ral eylotoxic gene products which accumulate to intolerable levels in transformed cells but not in normal ones. Fi iy, using cells transformed with polyom: 'as and genomic and subgenomic clones of polyomavirus, we showed that the extent of sensitization to killing by MVM depended on the transforming agent used. Certain parvoviruses possess the intriguing capability to destroy oncogenically transformed cells selectively in cule ture while having litle or no effect on the viability of the parental, untransformed cells. This preferential toxicity to Transformed cells may account forthe inhibition of intuced tumorigenesis (oncosuppression), reported to occur in Vivo 2.6, 8, 11, 22, 25-27). ""a variety of ells have been used to study the preferential killing effect of autonomous parvoviruses. These include tmouse 313 eels (13-15), several at lroblast cel ines (13), and human Rbroblasis and epithelial cells (3,4). A variety of transforming agents have also been used, including simian virus 40 (1, 4 10, 14, 13), avian erythroblestosis vins (3), human ras'oncogene (18), and radiation and chemical ca inogens (1,4). These studies show that (the killing efect. of transformed cells is dependent neither on the type of cell. for on the transforming agent used and (i) the preferential Killing of transformed cells is correlated with clevated expression of the viral genome. In this study, we invest- faled the question of whether the production of infectious Virus was required forthe selective iling effect of minute Virus of mice (MVM), “The Fischer rat embryo fibroblast cell line (F-11) chosen for this study is subject to astringent contact inhibition, its anchorage-independent grovih i extremely low, and it has @ very typieal broblastc appearance.

MYM(p) iofection caused a transient and slight cytopathic effect at days 1 and 2, after which the culture recovered and a normal growth rate was resumed. In contrast, the polyomavirusetransformed deriv- ative cell lines were destroyed completely by MVM(p) infection within 24 h (Fig. 1). The total yield of infectious virus produced in polyomavirus-transformed cells was 10° to 10%-fold higher than that produced in similarly infected ‘untransformed cell lines (Table 1). This difference range in virus yield is comparable with those of other permissive! restrictive systems for MVM (9, 20, 21, 24). A subline of mouse L-cells, A9 [which is used as a standard permissive cell line for MVM(p)], was also included in all our experi ments for comparison. Table 1 shows that virus production in A9 cells was only slightly lower than in F-111/Py cells. To investigate the relationship between the killing effect and virus production, cell killing during a single cycle of infection was quantitated by using an infectious center lassay. This assay was performed as follows. At 4 h post fection the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline to remove unattached and unabsorbed virus, trypsinized, suspended in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium containing 35 mM HEPES (N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'= 2ethanesulfonic acid) buller (pH 7.3) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, and counted. Serial dilutions were prepared in the above medium, poured onto 60-mm dishes Containing monolayers of § X 10° A9 indicator cell, and incubated for 4 10 8 h {0 allow all cells to attach. The monolayers were overlaid with agar, incubated for 5 to 6 days at 37°C, and then stained with 0.2% neutral red in Hanks salts solution containing 0 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.3, and 0.45% Bacto-Agar (Difco Laboratories). Plaques were counted 20 later. These assays consistently showed that the MVM(p) permissive fraction in F-111 cells was nearly identical to that found in the polyomavirus transfor mmants (Table 1), alhough the lethal effect of MVM(p) was fitch more pronounced on the latter. Furthermore, irmm nofluorescence staining revealed similar percentages of cells",6

ABSTRACT An enzyme from Saccharomyces cereisoe ‘that cleaves Holliday junctions was partially purified ~S00- (0 1000-fold by DEAE-celllose chromatography, gel ftration on ‘Sephacry1 $300, and chromatography on slag stranded DNA cellulose. The partaly purified enzyme did not have any detectable nuclease activity when tested with single-stranded or double-stranded bacteriophage T7 substrate DNA and did not have detectable endonuclease activity” when tested with bacterlophage M13 viral DNA or plasmid pBR322 covalently closed circular DNA. Analysis ofthe products ofthe cruciform Cleavage reaction by lerophoreis on peyacrylamie ees under denaturing conditions revealed thatthe eruelform struc: ture was cleaved at elther of two sites present in the stem of the ‘eruelform and was not cleaved at the end of the stem, The ‘rucform cleavage enzyme was able to cleave the Hollidsy Junction present in bacteriophage G4 figure-S molecules. Eighty percent of these Holliday Junctions were cleaved Inthe proper orientation to generate intact chromosomes during enctic recombination. Ic has been proposed that genetic recorsbinaton ofenin- volves the formation of an intermediate structure that con- tains a reciprocal single-stranded crossover between (wo homologous duplexes, the Holliday junction (1-3). When the ing genomes are circular, the Holliday intermediate has a figure-8 configuration. DNA molecules containing Holliday structures have been observed in recombining phage and plasmid DNA molecules isolated (com Escherichia coli and yeast cells and in chromosomal DNA isolated from yeast 4-10). The enzymology ofthe formation and resolution of Holliday structures is not well understood, but the RecA. and Recl proteins, from E. coli and Ustlago maydis, respectively, probably play a role in the formation of Holliday junctions in these organisms (11.12), Resolution of the Holliday junction requires cleavage of the crossed strands, realignment, and ligation to generate an intact recombinant duplex. The bacteriophage 17 gene 3 and bacteriophage 4 gene 49 endonucleases cleave arificialy constructed Holliday structures (13, 14). Conditionally eth ‘tuations in these genes lead to an ace branched DNA after infection, suggesting products may resolve branched recombin (3, 15-17). Artificial Holliday junctions containing. the bacteriophage A ait sites within the crossover repion ate cleaved by the A Int protein (28). The 14 and 7 enzymes. differ from the Int protein in that they have endonuclease activity on single-stranded substrates and lack sequence specificity whereas the Int protein has no single-stranded DNA-specific endonuclease activity and only cleaves Halliday junctions constructed from d at sites (14, 18, 19).

"06/28/08 08:17 50s 879 5850 BERK A-6 [CAPE COD TIMES FRIDAY, JUNE 28, 1996 Bourne board changes part of smoke ban Lighting up in most eateries, bars acceptable once again .y By MARK MERCHANT ‘STAFF WAITER, BOURNE —~ Just two months after new smoking regulations i ‘Bourne went into effect, the board of health voted Wednesday to amend them, sparing bars and res- taurants from the tougher rules. Cut in a 3-2 vote were the regula- tions that outlawed smoking in bars and restaurants with more than two employees by May 1, 2000. The new regulations outlaw smoking in other public buildings, ban cigarette vending machines, town, require businesses have a town permit to sell tobacco, limit where stores can display tobacco products and forbid giveaways of tobacco products. Those rules stayed the same, except for an ad- dition that prohibits smoking by ‘minors in restaurants. ‘The change pleased town res- taurant owners while upsetting those ‘who helped draft Bourne's original regulations. “Restaurant people take a big risk and lay their money on the line. To have a bureaucracy come in and tell them they have to do something that's going to hurt their business, ckat's not right.” said George Fianegan of Fimnie's Place on MacArthur Boulevard. “Atleast this will give the business- mena fair shake” Under the bar ban, anmual ex- ceptions would have been allowed if the smoking area of the restaur- ant was no more than 20 percent of the floor space and if the restaur- ant had a ventilation system that could move 60 cubic feet of air per mina por pereninend edebting eet pot eat Holly O'Brien, Program Director for the Cape Cod Regional Te- bacco Control Program, called the vote a grave disappointment and a blow to public health progress. The Tobacco Control Program and a consortium of the boards of health of Cape Cod, Wareham and Nan- tucket created the original draft regulations, which were then tal ‘en'back to the town health boar for local modifications. The defeat, she said, came in because of a concerted effort the tobacco industry to influ tence the board’s opinion. O'Brien provided copies of aie circulated in Bourne before the meeting urg- {ng people to turn out for the meet- ing and “speak out"" for their rights. The original regulations were adopted when the board's mem- bership had dwindled to three members from the five members that normally sit on the board — enough for @ quorum. Since the two-to-one vote, two new members ‘were elected to the board, bringing the body up to full strength and changing the majority. ‘The two new members, Michael Giancola and John Harrington, who authored Wednesday's changes, both said they opposed the regulations during their elec- tion campaigns: “They were one-issue candi- dates and there's so much going on with the health boards,"" O'Brien said. “T hope in two years we can go back to the board of health and ‘convince the new members this is dacsential for public health,” abe oor 06r828190z",9

"Phorbol ester and okadaic acid regulation of Na-2Cl-K cotransport in rabbit tracheal epithelial cells CAROLE M. LIEDTKE AND LINDA THOMAS Cystic Fibrosis Center, Department of Pediatrics at Rainbow Babies and Children Hospital, and Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio 44106 Liedtke, Carole M., and Linda Thomas. Phorbol ester ‘and okadaic acid regulation of Na-2CI-K cotransport in rabbit tracheal epithelial cells.Am. J. Physiol. 271 (Cell Physiol. 40): ‘C838-C346, 1996.—We evaluated a role for protein kinase C (PKC) in the regulation of rabbit tracheal epithelial Na-Cl(K) cotransport, Short-term treatment with phorbol 12-myristate S-avetate (PMA) dose dependently increased bumetanide- sensitive Na and Cl efflux and elevated staurosporine- and >bumetanide-sensitive Na, Cl, and K uptake. PMA and the ayvadrenergic agonist guanabenz both induced cotransport with a stoichiometry of 2 Cl:1 Na and 2 Cl:1 Rb and elevated staurosporine-sensitive PKC activity in cytosolic and particu- late fractions. Prolonged PMA treatment did not sustain bumetanide-sensitive 2 Cl:1 Na and 2 Cl:1 Rb transport but did block stimulation of bumotanide-sensitive transport by PMAor guanabent and elevation of PKC activity by PMA and guanabenz in a particulate fraction. Cells treated with oka- daic acid exhibited a staurosporine- and bumetanide-sensi- tive 2 Cl:1 Na and 2 CL: Rb uptake. In cultured monolayers, basolateral perfusion with epinephrine, isoproterenol, or PMAincroasod ehort-cirouit eurrent ([y)-Basolateral applica- tion of bumetanide reduced elevated J. to baseline levels, indicating a role for Cl secretory cells in a reconstituted tracheal epithelium, Pretreatment of transmonolayer cul ‘tures with PMA diminished the stimulatory response to epinephrine. These results indicate that, in rabbit tracheal epithelial cells, a-adrenergic stimulation activated Na-2C1-K at PKG is a critical effector in this process. ‘a-adrenergic receptors; loop diuretics; bumetanide; protein phosphatase; guanabenz; epinephrine; clonidine; transmono- layer cultures; staurosporine; protein kinase C ‘ONE MODE OF TRANSPORTING the electrolytes Na and Cl ‘that is common to many cell types is cotransport of the electrolytes Na and Cl, which is directly coupled to the inwardly directed Na electrochemical gradient as the driving force for Cl uptake. An additional requirement for K is seen in some cells under specific stimulatory conditions, such as, for example, vasopressin stimula tion of mouse medullary thick ascending limb (82). We have previously shown that Na-Cl cotransport in hu- man and rabbit tracheal epithelial cells is activated by a-adrenergic agonists (15) and hyperosmotic challenge (16). The Ca ionophore ionomycin mimics the response too-adrenergie stimulation. Other studies show second- ary activation of cotransport in canine tracheal epithe- lial cells, which is mediated by agents that stimulate cal Cl channels to induce Cl secretion (10, 11). These studies correlated stimulation of salt secretion by isopro- terenol, ATP, and UTP to the equilibrium level of saturable, basolateral bumetanide-binding sites. The caa8 finding of increased bumetanide binding with induction of Cl secretion was interpreted as upregulation of cotransport in Cl secretory cells. Our finding of direct activation of cotransport by a adenosine 3',5'-eyclic monophosphate (cAMP)-indepen- dent mechanism led to detailed studies of the intracel- lular signaling of the a-adrenergic stimulation. The studies first focused on effectors involved in Ca-dependent mecha- nisms for signal transduction. The results demonstrate a-adrenergic activation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5- bisphosphate (Ptdins(4,5)Pz}-specific phospholipase C with subsequent hydrolysis of Ptdine(4,5)P, to two intracellular second messengers, inositol phosphate (17) and diacylglycerol (18). The transient nature of mediator release within a time frame that coincides with cotransporter activation suggested a link between Ca and diacylglycerol. These two intracellular media- tors are activators for some isotypes of protein kinase C (PKC; Ref. 31). PKC subsumes a family of at least 10 subtypes, some of which require Ca for activation (26, 31), PKC has been linked to the regulation of other electrolyte trans- porters, including cation and anion exchangers that operate during cell volume regulation, salt absorption, and pH regulation and ion channels that are required for secretion, in particular an apical Cl channel (2, 4,6). ‘A useful tool in identifying and characterizing PKC regulation is phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), phorbol ester that activates PKC (31). The effects PMA often show a time dependence that is interpreted as resulting from activation (early) or downregulation Cate) of PKC. For example, with some ion exchangers, such as Na/H or CVHCO, (of thyroid and Vero cells, respectively), short-term treatment with PMA acti- vates ion exchange, whereas long-term treatment with PMA, which chronically activates PKC, fails to alter electrolyte transport through ion exchangers (22, 34). In the latter instance, chronic activation of PKC leads ‘to downregulation due to increased sensitivity to prote- lysis (81). Short-term PMA treatment can induce opposing responses, as seen in intestinal and renal epithelial cells (35). In these cells, Ne/H exchangers found on apical membranes are inhibited by PMA, which produces an opposite effect of stimulation on cation exchangers in the basolateral surface. PMA also influences the activity of Na-Cl-K eotrans- porters in epithelial and nonepithelial cells. Fibro- blasts (27, 30), endothelial cells (26), and osteoblasts (88) express a cotransporter that is sensitive to PMA, ‘thus suggesting regulation through PKC. Phorbol ester- stimulated cotransporters of cell lines derived from epithelia, such as colonic HT-29 (1) and T84 cells (12), (0365-61496 $5.00 Copyright © 1996 the American Physiological Society",6

"Bacty's Igdvstrial Hygiene and Toxicology Vol:3A ch:07-202 The Fundamentais be 2.2 The Fundamentals behind the TLVs The ACGIH TLVs and most other OELs are limits that refer to airborne concentrations of substances and represent conditions under which ""it is believed that nearly all workers may be repeatedly exposed day-after-day without adverse health effects"" ((4) ACGIH, 1992). It is important to recognize that unlike some exposure limits for ambient air pollutants, contaminated water, or food additives set by other professional groups or regulatory agencies, exposure to the TLV will not necessarily prevent discomfort or injury for everyone who is exposed ((7) Adkins et al., 1990). The ACGIH recognized long ago that because of the wide range in individual susceptibility, a small percentage of workers may experience discomfort from some substances at concentrations at or below the threshold limit and that a smaller percentage may be affected more seriously by aggravation of a preexisting condition or by development of an occupational illness (47) Cooper, 1973; (140) Omenn, 1982; (4) ACGIH, 1992). This is clearly stated in the introduction to the ACGIH's annual booklet “Threshold Limit Values for Chemical Substances and Physical Agents and Biological Exposure Indices"" ((4) ACGIH, 1992). : This limitation, although perhaps less than ideal, has been considered a practical one since airborne concentrations so low as to protect hypersusceptibles have traditionally been judged infeasible due to either engineering or economic limitations. This shortcoming in the TLVs has, until the past 4 years, not been considered a serious one. If society wishes to significantly reduce workplace exposures, by using engineering controls and personal protective equipment, it is now possible to do so. In light of the dramatic improvements of the past 10 years in our analytical capabilities, personal monitoring/sampling devices, biological monitoring techniques, and the use of robots as a plausible engineering control, we are now technologically able to consider more stringent occupational exposure limits. Whether we are willing to invest the financial resources needed to control workplace exposure to much lower levels or whether it makes good economic sense to do so is not yet known ((222) U.S. EPA SAB, 1990). Threshold limit values, like most other OELs used in other countries, are based on the best available information from industrial experience, experimental human and animal studies, and, when possible, from a combination of the three ((196) Smith and Olishifski, 1988; (4) ACGIH, 1992). The rationale for each of the values differs from substance to substance. For example, protection against impairment of health may be a guiding factor for some, whereas reasonable freedom from irritation, narcosis, nuisance, or other forms of stress may form the basis for others. The age and completeness of the information available for establishing most occupational exposure limits also varies from substance to substance; consequently, the precision of each particular TLV is subject to variation. The most recent TLV and its documentation should always be consulted in order to evaluate the quality of the data upon which that value was set. The background information and rationale for each TLV is published periodically in the Documentation of the Threshold Limit Values (ACGIH, 1989). Some type of documentation is ‘occasionally available for OELs set in other countries. The rationale or documentation for a particular OEL should always be consulted before interpreting or adjusting an exposure limit, as well as the specific data considered in establishing it ((4) ACGIH, 1992). Even though all of the publications that contain OELs emphasize that they were intended for use only in establishing safe levels of exposure for persons in the workplace, they have been used at times in other situations. itis for this reason that all exposure limits should be interpreted and applied only by someone knowledgeable of industrial hygiene and toxicology. The TLV committee did not intend that they be used, or modified for use: 2073095202 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 1998. ALL rights reserved. = a",6

Weinberg ‘Two independent lines of work, each pursuing cellular oncogenes, have con- verged over the last several years. Ini- ally, the two research areas confronted problems that were ostensibly uncon- ected. The first focused on the mecha nisms by which a variety of animal reo. viruses are able. to transform infected ‘mechanisms responsible for tumors of soaviral origin, such as those human ‘uumors traceable to chemical causes. We pow realize that common molecular de- ‘erminants may be responsible for ni mors of both classes.

"Cultured Endothelial Cells Produce a Heparinlike Inhibitor of Smooth Muscle Cell Growth : JOHN |. CASTELLOT. Jk., MARY L. ADDONIZIO, ROBERT ROSENBERG, AND MORRIS | KARNOVSKY Department of Pathology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts O2115, and the Sidney Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, Assteact Using cultured cells from bovine and rat aortas, we have examined the possibility that endothelial cells might regulate the growth of vascular smooth muscle cells. Conditioned medium from confluent bovine aortic endothelial cells inhibited the proliferation of growth- arrested smooth muscle cells. Conditioned medium from exponentiat endothelial cells, and from exponential or confluent smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts, did not inhibit smooth muscle cell growth. Conditioned medium from confluent endothelial cells did not inhibit the growth of endothelial cells or fibroblasts. In addition to the apparent speciticity of both the producer and target cell, the inhibitory activity was heat stable and not atfected by proteases. 1 was sensitive to Flavabacterium heparinase but not to hyaluronidase or chondroitin sulfate ABC lyase. It thus appears to be a heparinlike substance. Two other lines of evidence support this conclusion. First, a crude isolate of glycosaminoglycans (1CA-soluble, ethanol-precipitable material) from endothelial cell-conditioned medium reconstituted in 20% serum inhibited smooth muscle cell growth; glycosaminoglycans isolated feom unconditioned medium (ie, 0.4% serum) had no effect on smooth muscle cell growth. No inhibition was seen if the glycosaminoglycan preparation was treated with heparinase. Second, exogenous hepatin, heparan sultate, chondroitin sulfate B (detmatan sulfate), chondroitin sulfate ABC, and hyalu- ronic acid were added to 20% serum and tested for their ability to inhibit smooth muscle cell growth. Heparin inhibited growth at concentrations as low as 10 ng/ml, Other glycosamino- Blycany had no effect at doses up to 10 ug/ml. Anticoagulant and non-anticoagulant heparin were equally effective at inhibiting smooth muscle cell growth, as they were in vivo following endothelial injury (Clowes and Karnovsk.

"January 16, 1995 To: J.P. Coggins From: R. C. Pasterczyk Re: A #2 Learning about Com (BIAD #95-11149) From the socond A&A I pulled key evaluative and communication measures about the competitive DM piece alone, the ads alone, and the combination of both among the competitive set. * Overall, the No B.S. DM piece communicated much of the desired imagery at higher levels than the comparable Fabric piece. Specifics include: a brand my friends would smoke, offers advantages over other brands, for person who enjoys simple things in life, a no B.S. person, for ‘a person who does his/her own thing. ‘They were comparable on true to convietions, strong sense of right & wrong, what you see is what you get, and rejects artificiality. + Thokey positive attribute provided by the No B.S. comedy video was peer acceptance (a brand my friends would smoke). Otherwise, it did not do a better job than the ads alone to evoke the feolings desired, Additionally, the synergy of both the DM pices and ads together did not increase the overall communication above cither of the clements separately. This suggests, as ‘we said in the original comedy quantitative study, that while the video registers high on ‘entertainment value it needs to incorporate more of the “meat” associated with the product point of difference. (As you recall, we even wondered if there was some way to adapt the ingredient demonstration portrayed in the Fabric comedy video into the No B.S. format.) + For Fabric, the ""sensory overload"" we have already identified with this campaign along with the alienation brought about by the female midriff executions, resulted in poor scores overall for the ads alone, The video improved purchase intent, importance, difference, and believabilty, apparently based on the ingredient demonstration. Likewise, these same positives for the video alone rubbed off when combined with the ads. The tonality of this video is, judgmentally, more of a problem (ie., lame, borrowed interest). Tnterms of share, the video adds about a tenth of a share point to the share forall campaign approaches. Any questions or to discuss further, please call, Rage cc: B.C, Leary, CS. Nicholson, D.

Green Dr. Alan Rodgman Memorandum: For at least the last five years the Analytical Division has provided mass spectral analysis as a service to the Chemical Division. Since the usage of glass capillary gas chromatography has become more common the chromatographers have found that they must work more and more closely with the mass spectroscopist. In fact, the mass spectrometer has become the detector of choice for glass capillary gas chromatography. These two areas have become so closely allied that the quality of the chromatographic results are often limited by the mass spectral data and conversely the quality of the mass data is often limited by the efficiency of the chromatographic columns. For these reasons I propose the formation of a GC-MS spectroscopy working group consisting of Fred Thome, George Young and myself. The long-range goals of this group would be as follow: 1, Continue research into the preparation of efficient, stable and inert glass capillary columns. 2, Continue research into techniques for the best utilization of glass capillary columns such as ""splitless injection"" and “closed loop"" headspace sampling (not Tenax). 3. Prepare glass capillary columns for all members of the Research Dept. and give advice for their proper and full utilization. 4. Prepare glass capillary colums especially for use with the mass spectrometer. 5. Develop improved techniques for interfacing glass capillary columns to the mass spectrometer. 6. Develop the techniques of combined GC-Specific Ion mass spectroscopy. 7. Develop the techniques of combined GC-Chemical Ionization mass spectroscopy. 9686 96205 IRI FORM 2422-Rev. 7/70",0

High per- formance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of brain tissue {rom which the pineal, hypothalamus, and pituitary had been emoved confirmed recently the natural occurrence ot ‘Tyr-MIF-1 (unpublished observations). In_addtion, the presence of saturable, specifi, high afinty binding sites for ‘Tyr MIP-I has been demonstrated in rat brain; MIF-1 does not effectively compete for these sites [23] Ina test of pas- sive avoidance, administration of Tyr-MIF-1 resulted in sig niffeant changes not seen with MIF-1 at the dose tested (8), whereas significant changes in reserpine-induced hypothermia in mice were seen with MIF-1 but not ‘Tyt- MIF-1 (9). Although braia enzymes can degrade Tye-MIF-1 into MIF-1 [18}, unpublished observations indicate that the elects of injected Tyr-MIF-1 are not mediated by conver- sion in blood to MIF-1. Together these results demonstrate thatthe ozcurence of Tyr-MIT-1 cannot be accounted for bY MIF-I and raise the possiblity that atleast some of the 2c- tions of MIF-1 might not be shared by Tyr-MIF-1. ‘One of the actions MIF-1 can exert is that of an opiate antagonist.

Diluent (0.9% NaCl acidified to 0.01 M with acetic acid) and, occasionally, naloxone (generously pro- vided by Endo Labs) were used for comparison with MIF-I. Experiment 1 Male, albino ICR mice weighing between 17-20 g at the time of the experiment were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). Each mouse was tested ina 2.5x3 em Plexiglas tube with 2 em (I em from tip) of exposed tail covering small opening through which heat emanated from a nichromte thermal wire. A digital electronic timer was activated manually. Removal of the tail (tail-flick) from the grooved tray closed a photoelectric circuit and de- activated the timer. A rheostat maintained the heat so that the basal latency was about 4.5 sec. Each trial automatically fended at 17 sec. ‘Ten min before injection of morphine, each mouse re- ceived an intraperitoneal (TP) injection (10 ml/kg) of a freshly prepared, coded solution of MIF-L, Tyr-MIF-1, or diluent ‘Twenty mice were used at each IP dose of 0 (diluent), 0.001, 0.01, 0.4, 1.0, and 10.0 mg/kg; no mouse was used for more than oe dose of any solution.

The two cases on which Mike has been engaged relate to an indus incinerator in East Liverpool, Ohio, and I am informed by Mike that they are nearly concluded, Mike has received a request from the Attorney General's Office for a waiver from CTR of any objection to Thompson Hine & Flory representing CTR concurrently with Mike's representation of the State in the two incinerator cases.

None of the attorneys working on behaif of CTR at Thompson Hine & Flory has assisted Mike in the environmental representation, and none has worked at any time on any matters for the State of Ohio. If CTR has no objection to Thompson Hine & Flory representing its interests in this action, I would ask that you forward to my attention a written waiver in substantially the form as that which Tam enclosing as a draft. I will then forward it to the Attorney General for her files.

"May 30, 1974 To: All Marketing Department Personnel This requests your assistance in attaining tighter security of sensitive Company information which you possess or to which you may have access. Security is a necessary discipline at all times in business operations but is especially critical to the Company at this time due to the vast number and significance of many projects in which we are currently involved--and especially in view of recent ""leaks"" of new brand and promotional/ advertising programs under development. Disclosure of such information can be of substantial advantage to our competitors and works to undermine the hard work and dedication which all of us_try to bring to our contribution to Company growth and profits. Accordingly, effective immediately, we're adopting the following program to assure that information remains confidential to those parties directly involved with any sensitive Company matter: I. Our Own Attitudes - Any program of this nature requires each of us to become more concerned about the harm that disclosure of sensitive information can cause. Thus, we must assess the sensitivity of all matters we deal with and =, treat each one according to its degree of confidentiality. II, Need to Know - Only those parties needing access to sensitive Information in order to make their contribution to the subject should have access to it. This means: A, No copies are to be made of documents entitled (1) ""Confidential"" (unless the originating party grants permission for such copies) or (2) ""Secret"" (except by the originator). B.
