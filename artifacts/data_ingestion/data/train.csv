for smokers to quit—begins at midnight at no other time is there such widespread sup port for taking the courageous step of kicking the nicotine habit tomorrow smokers will find ‘encouragement not just rom the american can ‘cer society sponsor of the annual event but also from businesses worksites and restaurants some 5 million smokers went 24 hours with ‘out lighting up during last years smokeout the idea is to experience being smokefree for one day “even if its just to prove to themselves that they can doit” saysa bulletin from the american cancer society if some smokers try it like it and never light up again well then all the better they can join the ‘welling ranks of former smokers—at last count ‘some 35 million people have kicked the habit since 1964 the date of the landmark surgeon generals report linking cigarettes to cancer ‘theres no need to elaborate on all the health benefits of quitting the risk of lung cancer em  physema the higher incidence of cancer of the esophagus pancreas bladder and kidney the ‘earlier onset of megopause for women and wrin iling of the skin smokers know all that  « ‘smokers also know better than anyone else the hassles and the mess of smoking thedeep  throaty hack the stained teeth and the tobacco  breath the smell that lingers in clothes carpet ing and drapes anything that absorbs the billows of smoke not to mention the cigarette burns a carpet and furniture  ‘they also know the cost not just the 125 a‘ ‘pack but the extra time lost from work smok ers have more colds than nonsmokers and their children have more inner ear infections than chil dren who live in a smokefree bome and there is growing evidence that the nonsmoking spouses ‘of smokers have higher rates of heart and lung  diseases 2    smokers’are

1995 is going to have to smoke alone or with other smokers” koop’ said that might mean ‘smoking in the bathroom inthe backyard or in a segregated area“i wouldnt be surprised” he said to see smoking inited to “out of doors ‘businesses are also jumping on the antismidk ing bandwagon by restricting smoking to certain areas and sometimes banning it altogether from the worksite one firm warned smokers that they would have to pay higher health care insur ance premiums out oftheir own pockets if they didt give up smoking the company then gave smokers year to quit provided smoking ces sation programs and 12 months later charged a 200 fee to employes who sill smoked today with the benefit of growing research on nicotine no one suggests that it is a snap to it—nor do they consider kicking the habit an impossible task the smoking eld says univer sity of michiganpsychologit ovide pomerleau “has come a long way from the time when we tooked at smoking ina moralistic way”  nicotine isa complex drug with a multitude of ‘effects on the body including the unique ability both to stimulate and to sedate research is pro ducing new knowledge about effective ways t0 ‘quit smoking—not for a few days or a few weeks but for good the goal is to achieve emokefree society bythe year 2000 scientists are getting new insight into wi drawal were merging psychology with phar smacology” pomerleau

2acetylaminofluorene 2aaf followed by tumor promotion using dietary phenobarbital pb ex posure animals receiving only 2aaf or pb do not possess this new aldehyde dehydrogenase activity the phenotype is characterized by the appearance of a new cytosolic isozyme kinetcally electrophoretically and immumochemically distinct from the normal liver aldehyde dehydrogenase iso zymes and from aldchyde dehydrogenases inducible in 2aapinduced hepatomas the new isozyme is naddepen ‘ent dislfiramsenstive and crossreacts with antiserum to a normal liver aldehyde dehydrogenase inducible in several lines of rats by pb however the population of animals used inthis study has been shown previously to be nonresponsive to aldehyde dehydrogenase induction by dietary pb since no animals receiving only pb express this new isozyme the ar cinogen must play a significant role in its induction more ‘over that not all animals receiving carcinogen and promoter possess the phenotype suggests this carcinogeapromoterin eraction has a genetic basis introduction work in our laboratory is directed toward elucidating the ‘mechanisms underlying the expression of a unique aldehyde dehydrogenase phenotype aldehydenadp oxidoreduc tase ec 1213 and 131 in hepatomas induced in ‘spraguedawley rats by 2acetylaminofluorene 2aaf 15 the phenotype is characterized by an increase in total aldehyde dehydrogenase activity due to the appearance of several cytosolic isozymes not present in normal live the tumor isozymes are very active with aromatic aldehyde substrates and nadp as coenzyme and have electrophoretic obits isocletrie points and immunochemical properties distinct from those of normal liver aldehyde dehydrogenases 25 the tumor phenotype is not due to reexpression of fetal aldehyde dehydrogenase activity 4 to date we have observed no significant changes in aldehyde dehydrogenase activity in normal liver during 2aafinduced hepatocarcino genesis prior to the appearance of the

richard j sanderson kathleen rulon elly g groeneboer anp david w talmage “from the department of microbiology and the webb waring lung institute university of colorado health sciences center ‘denver colorado 80882 ‘the blastogenic and mitogenic response of murine splenic lymphocytes to concanavalin a and the response of the resulting blasts to a lymphokine costimulator preparation was cxamined with an electronic particle counting and sizing apparatus coulter counter and channelizer mitogenesis as determined by increase in cell number correlated well with the timeintegrated uptake of tritiated thymidine it was found that costim ulator was highly mitogenic to the lectininduced blasts and that the cells appearing in response to it were uni formly large costimulator blasts furthermore the eventual increase in cell number was proportional to the costimulator concentration at least for the concentra tions cell numbers and incubation times examined this relatively simple assay that uses the coulter counter and channelizer is therefore capable of substituting for serial measurements of tritiated thymidine uptake and yields additional information on the volume spectra of responding cells as well as forming the basis for assay ing costimulator activity ‘the costimulator blasts were found to be capable of killing a wide variety of allogenele as well as syngeneic concanavalin a induced blasts the level of killing in a sehr “cr release assay varied between 9 for the syn geneic caso and 24 of the maximum obtained by water lysis ‘the proliferation oflymphocytes in eeponse to concanavalin ‘a con a has been shown to be mediated by the release of a ymphokine costimulator 1 although it has been shown to ‘be nonmitogenic to resting lymphocytes 1 we wil show here that cotimulator causes a strong proliferation ina cell popt lation previously stimulated by con a and that this prolifer ating population contains cytotoxic cells its now that when spleen of lymph node cells are mixed with allogeneic tumor call membranes or normal calls killer cells may ar may not ‘be produced 210 depending presumably on the ability of the allogeneic calls to stimulate the production of costimalator in the responding cell population the addition of previously prepared costimulator leads to  cytotoxic response to the otherwise nonstimulatory allogeneic eels 2 or

biology elizabeth pennisi reports from sarasoa fla atthe annual meeting ofthe association for chemoreception sciences foods that fool the body with low fat nutritionists and food companies may have more success promoting healthy diets if they concentrate on reducing fat in specific foods unfortunately ice cream isnt one of them people can judge the fat content of milkbased products ‘much more easily than the fat in mixed foods such as chicken salad report beverly j tepper and susan e shaffer of rutgers university in new brunswick n ‘tepper and shaffer tested the ability of 73 people to judge the richness of various foods each person visited the research lab twice weekly for two weeks at each five versions of six common foods the looked and tasted the same but varied in fat content and texture inone est participants judged the relative fat contents of the different versions by comparing them to one another in another test conducted ona different day they estimated théfat content of each version separately in neither test could participants accurately judge the fat content of scrambled eggs or chicken spread tepper says but in both tests they succeeded in ranking mashed potatoes and pudding — two milkbased foods they also distinguished the telative richness of crunchy snacks fried in different oils “in some foods people are going to notice the difference in fat content butin others you can make relatively large ‘changes without people noticing” tepper concludes alzheimer’s disease does the nose know an insidious disease alzheimer’s can start to develop long before one can detect troublesome losses in cognitive function however people with this disease also lose some of their sense ‘of smell researchers hope that monitoring changes in this sense will help them detect the disease earlier and aid in tracking its progression “the goal is to develop an early marker or something that ‘could change along with the disease” explains jack pearl of the national institute on deafness and other communication disorders in bethesda md “an olfactory test is a relatively noninvasive way of testing” ‘toward that end several research groups have begun studying the ability of older people with and without alzheim es to detect and remember odors ina study conducted at the university of california san diego medical center 65 people with alzheimer’s disease and ‘82 healthy people of similar ages and backgrounds underwent vision taste and odor tests the vision and taste components helped the scientists determine whether the participants were ‘of sound enough mind for testing and whether deterioration had occurred in more than one sensé ‘one of the odor tests required participants to sniff alcohol from pairs of plastic squeeze bottles and pick out the one with the stronger scent by supplying bottles with different concen trations of alcohol the researchers could tell at what concen tration the person first detected the odor the same people also sipped sugar water samples with differing degrees of sweet ness and were asked to spit out the sweeter one participants with alzheimer’s needed much stronger odors than the healthy sniffers say claire murphy and steven nordin who led the study “the more demented the person the higher the threshold but there was no such correlation for taste adds nordin “the research suggests there isa specific detection dysfunction to odors” furthermore he notes in the seven people with alzheimer’s disease who have now been tested for three years the average yearly change in the odordetection threshold has correlated with the progression of dementi a second experiment assessed the participants’ ability to recognize odors they had smelled earlier each person looked 300 at 10 faces of presidents and 10 engineering symbols and ‘smelled 10 common household odors they then examined a second set of faces symbols and odors half of which came from the first set participants tended to score the same when rating familiar faces and symbols as when rating odors they had sniffed earlier but alzheimers patients scored lower ‘overall indicating a general decline in memory says nordin at duke university in durham nc psychologist susan s ‘schiffman and her colleagues track changes in healthy people ‘who are at risk of developing alzheimer’s so far the study involves 22 such individuals and 22 people matched for age ‘gender race level of education and handedness who are not ‘considered at risk or the disease participants undergo several tests including ones in which they pick the stronger of two flavors or odors and are asked to remember familiar ones ‘the twogroups differ only intheirability toremember odors reports brevick g graham of duke “i wouldnt suggest that odor testing would ever replace any ‘of the cognitive measures but it might be used in addition to ‘other things for early diagnosis of alzheimer’s” he says theres no accounting for taste countless studies have indicated that animals avoid bitter foods but some actually prefer acrid flavors reports john 1 glendinning of the university of arizona in tucson while glendinning was at florida state university in tal lahassee he studied the eating habits of two species of wild mexican mice he discovered that while none of the peromyscus ‘melanotismice liked bitter flavors seven of 64 peromyscus azteca mice preferred quinine water over regular water he then offered both species hop extract tannic acid and two other bitter ‘substances “these chemicals are realy different bt neverthe less they all elicit similar responses” glendinning told science news “individuals that prefer quinine were more likely to prefer ‘other bitter chemicals” up to a certain concentration glendinning calls this the “schweppes effec” after the tonic water that some people prefer over regular water citing other studies showing that some goats opossums and squirrel monkeys like bitter foods he suggests that many animals ‘exhibit this effect although he doesnt really know why he suspects however that in foods — particularly plants — bitterness may reflect higher nutritional content how sweet a protein can be ‘a reddish fruit sold in nigerian markets has provided scientists with yet another supersweet protein ounce per ‘ounce this s2aminoacld protein called brazzein provides 2000 times the sweetness of sugar reports ding ming  biochemist atthe university of wisconsinmadison he and wisconsin colleague gran hellekant isolated the protein from pantadiplandra brazzeana a vine plant that produces a fruit slightly bigger than a grape “the sugar content isnot that high we guess thatthe sweet protein plays the same role as sugar” says ming sweetness may encourage animals to eat such fruits and help disperse seeds he explains brazzeins lysinerich amino acid sequence beats tittle resemblance to those of other sweet proteins sn 51990 315 which tend to contain many more amino acids says ming this protein also proves quite stable surviving 98°c temperatures for at least two hours and’ maintaining its sweetness in a wide range of acidic and alkaline solutions the researchers report moreover electrical recordings from taste ‘nerves of primates reveal thatthe protein elicits a purely sweet sensation with no aftertaste the wisconsin scientists have applied for a patent for the protein ‘science news vol 143

the scare— and diversification  by felix f fluss daa ryn be who analyses the us manufacturers’ growing tendency to branch out into nontobacco enterprises he r j reynolds tobacco company the biggest cigarette maker of the us announced recently that it hat acquired pacific havaiian products co a maker of cake mixes fruit beverages and shoe shine kits behind this move and other cigarette makers’ expansion of their rnontobacco activities are according to the opinion of several financial analysts some disquieting statistics in 1962 the annual increase of cigarette consumption was the smallest since 1954 according to estimates percapita consumption has remained at the same level as in 1961 this contrasts with an average growth rate fof approximately 3 packs a person ‘each year from 1957 through 1961 industrial observers claim that with this move another episode has been closed in the struggle of the us tobscco industry to combat adverse publicity linking cigarette smoking with lung cancer and other diseases although it has been pointed out that reynolds’ would probably hesitate to connect its diversification programme with fear for the smoking habit it has been claimed that over the past year or 40 and not least tince the publication in march 1962 of the unfavourable british report on “smoking and health” evidence has been mounting in the us against cigarette smoking as a health hazard in june 1954 the american cancer society published a study showing certain statistical correlations between smoking and lung cancer this was taken up by the popular press and for the first time a “cancer scare” ensued which was reflected in a decline jn smoking that year in the meantime the american public has repeatedly been exposed to the question of the relationship between gigarette smoking and lung cancers 1 few weeks ago the public once again hhas been confused by conflicting ements by the american cancer society and the tobacco institute the organisation of the us tobacco industry which through its ‘tobacco research committee sponsors a pro ‘gramme of research into questions of tobacco use and health so far 6250000 have been appropriated for this purpose however the surgeon general of the united states last october appoin ted a committee of leading scientists in order to obtain “a comprehensive review ofall available data on smoking and other factors in the environment that may affect health” intimating that the public should wait until the committee presents its findings prob ably this summer in 1929 reynolds bought for a very modest sum’ the tinfoil rolling company now the archer aluminum division this division supplies vireu ally all reynolds’ foil requirements and performs all the foil and paper colour printing ic sells its surplus to third parties both inside and outside the industry indeed the company believes itis an important factor in the foil market during the last 10 years or so the use of aluminium foil for frozen food for broiling and many other cooking and household purposes in the us thas increased at a rapid rate the main ‘outlets—food stores and supermarkets ‘sell packaged aluminium fol in large amounts reynolds has secured a sizeable shate of this market in 1958 185511 short tons of aluminium fol valued at 1405 million have been shipped in 1960 the value of ship ments rose to 1794 million the 1961 production

kinase n pkn were found to partially and in some cases tran siently block vge induction by ngf while in pkadeficient pci2 cells vgf induction by ngf was comparable to that ‘observed in parental pc12

through the actions of a number of tyrosine and serinethreonine kinases 3 the importance of protein phosphorylation in the mechanism of action of ngf has been reinforced by the identification of the product of the rk tyro sine kinase protooncogene as the high affinity ngf receptor 45 and the demonstration that tek is a necessary component of the ngf signaling pathoray that is required for neurite

secondhand smoke ts clear the air can cigarette smoke in the air cause disease in nonsmokers thatsan emotional question for smokers and nonsmokers alike sowell try to set the record straight in the most direct way we know there is little evidence—and certainly nothing which proves scientifically—that cigarette smoke causes disease among non smokers  youdont have to take our word for it us surgeon general julius b richmond—who was no friend of smoking—said in his 1979 report “healthy nonsmokers exposed to cigarette smoke have little or no physiologic response to the smoke and what response does occur may be due to psychological factors” andin the 1982 report surgeon general c everett koop could not conclude that passive smoking is a cause of cancer in non smokers the director of the national heart lung and blood institute dr claude lenfant has been one of the tobacco industry’ sharpest  critics yet dr lenfant stated in 1980 and we believe it remains true today that “the evidence that passive smoking ina general environ ment has health effects remains sparse incomplete and sometimes unconvincing” weve decided to speak out on passive smoking because there is so much rumor and rhetoric on this subject today and we intend to continue from time to time to speak out on other topics of concer toyouand tous our critics may try to discredit these messages as selfserving ina sense they will be right we will challenge allegations that are unproven and attacks we think are unfounded if that is selfserving sobeit the questions that surround smoking raise many important issues we believe that youre entitled to hear all sides of these controversies me mnautnncoce rj reynolds tobacco company e202 z9005,4

clone n6d11 described previously by negoro and seon cancer res 42 42594262 1982 directed to two ‘nique human tcel leukemia antigens we have shown previ ‘us that these monoclonal antibadies do not

conjugate preparation and the control igg conjugate preparation against leukemic t cet ines and normal bcel ines was tested by two different test procedures 1e by measuring direct killing of the cells and by ‘measuring inhibitory activity against protein synthesis inthe cells in each test the sn1 conjugate showed specific cytotoxic actv ity against t4eukemia cels whereas the control conjugate was ‘ot cytotoxic against either teukemia cells or normal bcels nearly compete kiling of teukemia cols and inhibition of protein synthesis in tleukemia cols were observed at the concentra tions of 10° to

inubitory activity ‘aganst protein synthesis in teukemia cells and contro cel with tleukemia cels specific inhibition was observed for both sni iggrria and sn2 iggria the combined use of these

requires ‘appropriate specie antibodies thus monocional antitumor an tibodies will be very uselul we have generated recently and characterized several mcabs® that are directed to human tcell leukemia antigens 14 28 these mcabs react with tall ceils but do not react with various nonteukemia cells nor with various normal cell including normal  and bcells thymocytes and bone marrow ces in the present study we selected 2 of these mcabs ie sn1 and sn2 for preparing immunotoxins imcab sn2 was obtained from hybxidoma clone n6d11 de scribed previously 14 these mcabs define unique individual human tcell

consists ‘of 2 subunits an a and a 8 chain which are inked by a dsulide bond reviewed in re 16 the 8 chain is a lectin which is pectic for galactose residues present on the surface of a wide variety of cells the binding of the ricin b chain to mammalian cells allows the ent of the entire rcin molecule and conse quently the ria into the cytoplasm whore the a ehain is spit from the 8 chain and acts on the 60s subunit of the iasome tocause irreversible inhibition of protein synthesis and cell death isolated ncn 8 chain binds to cel surfaces butis nontoxic while isolated ria is not significantly toxic because ofits inabilty to tficenty bind to cell surface and to traverse the cell membranes thus conjugates of ria with appropriate monocional ant tumor antibodies may provide immunotoxins

rjr interoffice memorandum subject highlights date april 28 1992 to brenda hodge from robert a heckman prelininary assessments of outside laboratory methods for pesticides an unusually large nunber of analytical methods were submitted to the coresta pesticide subgroup for consideration at its recent meeting meeting report to follow several of these methods were practiced by several menbers of my roup and myself in the months and weeks prior to the meeting which convened in famburg germany on april 20th sone of our findings which were diplomatically disclosed at the meeting are summarized below §c method for mh30 contributed by j k renaud of philip morris europe ‘this method entails a twohr extraction of tobacco with 2n hci containing a derivitizable internal standard formerly barbital but revised to gmethyluracil followed by neutralization and in situ methylation with dimethyl sulfate not having access to barbital i synthesized and characterized the 0ndimethy derivative of hh30 and used it as external standard for gc analysis using npd as prescribed the recovery of mh30 using ‘this approach a derivitizable internal standard was 37 other concerns are the acute toxicity of dimethyl sulfate relegation to use of a npd detector and responsiveness of the method to bound’residues of mh30 that are cnown to exist hplc method for hh30 contributed by g lionetti of the italian honopoly this method involves a 2n hc extraction of tobacco followed by passage of the extract through c18 and analysis by hplc using a c18 column we practiced this method intensely several weeks prior to the meeting and found an interference in untreated tobacco in the amount of 89 ppm this was communicated at the coresta subgroup meeting since the delegates from zimbabwe also stated that the method does not work i doubt that this direct approach will receive further serious attention internationally hplc method for kethoprene contributed by s s yang of philip morris usa big method involves a simple tsopropanol extraction of tobacco followed  hplc as described by rur but using diode array detection this method which has a limit of detection’of 1 ppm was also practiced intensely by us pkior to the meeting although we have seen this approach used successfully at’ dibril we have not achieved satisfactory chromatographic performance inhouse using conventional variable wavelength detection conversations with dr yang revealed that the method may be very sensitive to injection size this direct approach for high levels of methoprene will be studied further by us and several other coresta affiliates 8 e 8,0

date name addrese address dear name the occupational safety and health administration osha is currently considering workplace smoking regulations that if enacted would virtually ban smoking at all indoor worksites  including philip morris usa under this proposal employers would only be able to accommodate smokers if they constructed separate smoking rooms with completely separate ventilation systems advocates of these new rules are well aware that most employers cannot afford to provide separately ventilated smoking rooms and that the proposed rules actually constitute a nationwide workplace smoking ban even more troubling oshas definition of workplace is so broad it encompasses almost any indoor location where an employee is present  including your own home if you employ a plumber to fix your sink other workplaces where smoking would be banned include all restaurants bars hotel rooms private offices and company vehicles smoking would not even be allowed in a room rented for a private party or function fortunately there is still an opportunity to amend or even prevent the proposed workplace smoking rules from now until august 13 osha will accept public comment on the workplace smoking ban to have your comments entered into the official osea file on this issue please follow these three simple steps 1 take a few minutes to write a brief letter telling osha that designated smoking areas are preferable to the severe restrictions now being considered 2 make three copies of your letter this is to comply with federal law 3 put your original letter along with the three copies inside one envelope and mail to osha docket docket no h122 4660828202,0

rur mr derick a crawford august 4 1982 rjrmacdonald inc montreal re dr m h bilimoria dear derick confirming our telephone conversation in early july in my judg ment the bilimoriaecobichon projects with reference to studies on ambient tobacco smoke and on the “usefulness of the micronucle test should be rejected because they are unimaginative proposals without good scientific foundations and in addition have a number of political pitfalls however the most important reason for my recom mending their rejection is the scientific worthlessness of the project there has been a tremendous literature on the alleged relationships between carcinogenic activity and aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase ahh ‘the consensus at the present tine is that this reaction is not a good indicator or predictor for carcinogenic activity furthermore all animal models tried to date are unsuitable for simulating the alleged effects of smoking on human smokers and even more unsuitable for simu lating “passive smoking” in man this applies particularly to rats ‘this is shown for example in a very recent paper by s m loscutoff et al and a p wehner entitled dosimetry and cardiopulmonary function in rats chronically exposed to cigarette smoke ‘toxicology appl 64 335352 june 30 1962 which demonstrates and refers to previous literature showing that the smoke taken in is in complete disequilibrium with reference to gas phase particulate phase etc a compared to smoke taken in by human smokers any results which would be obtained by bilimoria regardless whether favorable or unfavorable from our point of view would be meaningless similar reasonings apply to the micronucleus test as a biological monitor of tobacco smoke exposure cigarette smoke has been shown many times to be mutagenic it has also been shown even by those who very strongly believe in mutagenesis ti that such tests at best have a qualitative significance and are quantitatively meaningless i personally hold an exceedingly dim view of even the qualitative usefulness of such tests adding another test to those already reported in the literature is in my judgment total waste i have been informed that dr fagan of philip morris has advised your counterpart in canada by telephone about a month ago or earlier that he considers the bilimoria projects worthless dr fagan has promised me that he will make an attempt to repeat his comments in writing bap  oece wzeos cc sbw pjve frank g colby ve cun ¥ gas,0

retroviruses during the latency period detween initial infection and subsequent tumorigenesis is poorly understood we used in situ hybridization to detect blv transcripts in individual peripheral bloed mononuclear cells from experimentally infected ‘asymptomatic sheep with latent infections viral rna was not found in most peripheral blood cells that had been isolated as rapidly as possible from circulating blood but it was present in rare cells bly rna transcripts increased in a biphasic manner within a few hours after the blood cells were placed in culture exposure to fetal bovine serum was identified as the principal cause of this transcriptional activation which ‘occurred in fewer than 1 in 1000 cells agents knovn to activate immune cells polyclonally caused a further increase inthe numberof cells containing bly rna within §h in some cases the numbers of vial transcripts within individual cells also increased thus bly is not detectably expressed io most resting lymphocytes ‘ireulating in the blood but its transcription is activated by components of fetal bovine serum and can be augmented by molecules that mine activation of immune cells this activation which might occur in lymphoid ussue during an imouune response may lead to the synthesis of viral regulatory proteins that are thought o initiate tumorigenesis through host cell genes bovine leukemia virus bly human tcell leukemia virus types i and il htlvi and htlvli respectively and human immunodeficiency virus hiv ate all retrovi rises that replicate in cells of the immune system infection by these viruses is followed by a long latency period and a certain proportion of infected individuals then rapidly prog ress to terminal disease because these viruses integrate essentially at random into the host genome and do not contain cellderived oncogenes it is thought that the viral gene products themselves lead to development of disease ‘the genomes of blv htly and hiv encode cransacting factors that regulate viral transcription but litle is known about how viral transcripts that encode these regulatory proteins are initially induced for hiv recent evidence ‘suggests that immune responses to unrelated antigens trigger virus replication and contribute o disease progression re viewed in reference 15 bly htlyi and htlvt are tumorigenic retroviruses that cause leukemia and lymphoma reviewed in references 4 ‘and 53 and are distinet from hiv a lentivirus that causes fatal immunodeficiency and neuropathy of the central ner ‘vous system reviewed in reference 15 blv and htlvi share numerous features of infection and pathology they also have similar genomic structures 43 and use common ‘strategies for gene expression the 3” ends ofthe genomes of htlv and bly contain the x sequences encoding a set of novel proteins 30 39 41 45 that are necessary for ecient transcription from the viral promoter 7 11 40 and that determine the relative proportions of spliced and unspliced transcripts 12 25 27 aside from host range a notable difference between the two viruses is that blv infection is associated with malignancy of b cells whereas htlv affects t cell ‘corresponding author ‘tumor cells contain at least part of one provirus but the viral genome is not detectably expressed 16 28 which suggests that viral gene products are not necessary 10 maintain the transformed state the x proteins encoded by the virus may set in motion a series of events leading 10 secondary genetic changes that result in malignant transfor mation 54 its important for two reasons to know where ‘and under what conditions viral genes are expressed before tumor development begins  intermittent production and spread of the virus would favor transformation simply by increasing the population of cells at risk for such a genetic change i it is possible that the xencoded proteins tax and rex could be produced from a subgenomic message without production of virions and that tax itself is

medical institete university of pennsyleania school of medicine philadelphia pennsseania 191086072 we have explored the structure and pattern of expression of a gene designated mdmj which plified 2530fold in transformed mouse cells cont ing numerous double minute particles this gene is ‘expressed in all mouse tissues examined but exhibits ‘elevated and altered patterns of expression in the tes ‘multiple transcripts are generated from the mdm ia mechanisms of alternative splicing and pol yadenylation signal choice these mlnas have the potential to produce a minimum of three distinct pro tein products ranging in size from 26 to 77 kilodaltons ‘antiserum generated against a synthetic peptide from the midm1 gene was used in immunoblotting studies ‘and rovealed that at least one of the protein products is present in the nucleus this antiserum stained nuclear structures producing a distinct punctate or speckled pattern ‘a number of genes have been implicated in altered growth control pathways associated with cellular transformation bishop 1987 clues leading to the identity of some of these genes have come from cancer cells themselves in the form of consistent chromosomal changes these changes include s tifie deletions and translocations as well as the appearance ‘of double minute chromatin particles dms in some tumor cells dms are small acentromerie chromatin bodies that result from a process of gene amplification dms are rately if ever observed in normal cells but have been described in a variety of tumor cells and transformed cell lines george 1984 and in cells sclected for resistance to various antime tabolites sehimke 1984 stark and wabl 1984 a deimon stration thatthe appearance of dms results from the aberrant replication andor recombination of  segment

has pro vided evidence that cells containing dms most likely are selected for and niaintained in the population because the tms contain amplified copies of one or more genes which ‘confers resistance

cells and transformed cel lines ‘often include proviously characterized protooncogenes or re lated genes george 1984 these data suggest that the plication and consequent overexpression of particular

1987 we have ‘obtained evidence that none of 20 previously identified on cogenes growth factors of growth factor receptor genes are “amplified in these cells cahillysnyder et al 1987 however the dms are stable in the 3t3dm cells and therefore may ‘well contain  previously unidentified gene with poter transforming activity or influence in the control of cellular proliferation to begin to

camerican heat journal september 1980 volume 100 number 3 editorial ‘smoking and coronary heart disease what are we to believe carl c seltzer phd cambridge mess ‘two recent events have raised serious questions ‘as to what we are to believe about the conven tional view that cigarette smoking is a cause of coronary heart disease chd interpretation of exsmoker ‘the first event relates to the interpretation of exsmoker data indicating that chd mortality rates of persons who stopped smoking are substantially lower than those of persons who continued smoking the interpretation given to these data is that smoking cessation directly results in the reduction of risk of heart disease mortality the most commonly cited investiga tions in support of this line of thinking are the observational studies of doll and hills british doctors hammonds american men and wom en’ kahes us veterans’ and the framingham study’ underlying this alleged chd benefit however is the assumption that exsmokers are a representative sample of smokers except in 20 far as they have stopped smoking but the proof of the validity of this assumption has not been forthcoming this is a crucial point in the comparison of the chd outcomes in the two smoking groups for if the assumption of repre sentativeness is invalid and significant baseline ferences are observed between exsmokers and samokers for relevant factors then the possibility recs fa ubicton 2p 1199 regrnt meets caf € sekar prd harvard usiety 11 ‘deut roe combe mas 28 ‘hacer senior ravech ameit harvard ivi exists that the mortality comparison of exsmok ‘ers and continuing smokers is biased for the first time in a very large series of subjects according to race and sex we observed the proper baseline for the determination of whether or not exsmokers were a representative ‘sample of smokers” this baseline involved the study of the chdrelated characteristics of ex smokers before they stopped smoking and their ‘comparison with those of persistent smokers the results of this study are briefly reviewed below using the longitudinal records from the kaiser permanente multiphasic health checkups the study compared 25 chdrelated characteristics of exsmokers before they stopped smoking with ‘those of persistent smokers and nonsmokers a total of more than 25000 subjects white men and women black men and women with three or more consecutive health checkups formed the basis of the analysis for the criteria of the classification ofthe subject the designated “in dex examination” and the list of chdrelated characteristic the reader is referred to the publi cation the minimum of three or more examina tions was used in order to insure a rigorous classification of the smoking categories thus examokers peristent quitters were subjects who had at least one examination at which they reported both a current and past history of cigarette smoking followed by at least two exam nations in which they reported complete cessa tion of smoking the chdrelated characteristics fell into arbitrary categories cardiovascular manifestations blood pressure hypertension american heart journal 278 masterspp 002015 11063829,6

effect of activin a on globin gene expression in purified human erythroid progenitors by lien shao normand l gon jr arlene l young alice l yu lawrence s mathews joan vaughan wylie vale and john yu ‘the regulatory control of human erythropoiesis through a purified protein activin a was examined previous studios ing mixed populations of bone marrow calls suggested that activin  has an indirect effect on cellular proliferation ‘and dna synthesis of erythroid progenitors through the ‘mediation of accessory cells in prosent studies the cultures ‘of purified erythroid progenitors were used to examine the ‘effect of activin a on globin gene expression human ery throid burstforming units bfue were partially purified ‘rom priharal ond ated consisted mainly of erythroid colonyforming units crue t wes found that the subsequent 7day cultures of ‘these purified progenitors yielded similar numbers and size listributions of erythroid colonies regardless of the pres ‘ence of activin ain the cultures in addition these erythroid progenitor cells wore responsi dna synthesis to the addition of erythropoietin but ‘treatment by activin a therefore once the erythroid pr astivin § was fin pure to tomogenty rom ‘gonadal fluids and shown to stimulate the secretion of pituitary folictestimulating hormone’ it was found that activin a could modulate the colony formation of erythroid bburstforming units bfue and erythroid colonyforming units cfue in human bone marrow culture’ and could also induce human ks62 and mouse friend cells to become positively stained by benzidine recently a protein that exhibited this inducing activity toward friend cells was isolated from human thp1 cells and found to be identical with activin a because it was encoded by the same mrna a that of activin a in addition it was found that this ‘protein was expressed atleast at the rna level in the bone ‘arrows of rats these data all suggest a possible role of activin a in the regulatory control of erythropoiesis” however mechanisms of the action of activin a on the process of erythropoiesis remain largely unknown twas reported that activin a increases the proliferative state of erythroid progenitors from both bone marrow and peripheral blood and that this effect on erythroid cell proliferation is exerted indirectly ie through mediation of both monocytes and t lymphocytes it was also suggested that activin a may drive immature erythroid precursors to form hemoglobinized cells thereby rendering the colonies recognizable as erythroid colonies’ conceivably activin ‘a may have effects on both cellular proliferation and ‘enthroid differentiation in the accompanying report activin a was found to induce accumulation of hemoglobins and stimulate the many globin transcripts in ks62 cells unlike our previous studies using mixed populations of hematopoietic ecll the present investigations address the issues of the effects of activin a on highly purified preparations of human

spectrom etry of o  fellbleomyein mixtures indicates that an ‘unstable ternary complex forms quickly and yields an optical spectral species closely resembling feiibleomycin 13 ‘the formation of this second species coincides with the ap pearance of epractive material scheme 1 we expected these spectral changes to coincide with dna cleavage but found that the degradation of dna was far slower 7 and that the dnaclesving activity was also more persistent we therefore redirected our attention to events signaled by the  this investigation was supported i pare by united health service grant hi 18390

————— editorials molecular dosimeters of siioking damage in the lung 2073736740 margaret r spitz mariza de andrade john di giovanni ‘traditional epidemiologic research relied on selfreported ‘measures of “extemal exposure” in defining the association be tween cigarette smoking and cancer risk with elucidation of carcinogeninduced geneuic and epigenetic events knowledge of the molecular etiology of smokingrelated cancers has expanded rapidly and has facilitated the study of tobacco carcinogenesis the dose of tobacco carcinogens to which lung tissue is ex posed is modulated by genetic polymorphisms in the enzymes responsible for activation phase 1 and detoxification phase fl of tobacco carcinogens for example the cytochromes p50 multigene superfamily of enzymes is involved in phase i oxida tive processes that may create intermediates that are more reac tive than the parent compounds and can be carcinogenic or mu tagenic phase ti metabolic processes generally inactivate these genotoxic compounds through conjugation that promotes cellu lar excretion the activated intermediates covalently bind 10 dna and form carcinogenmacromolecular adducts indispens able for maintaining genomic imegrity and fidelity ae the dna repair mechanisms that protect cellular dna from the deleteri ‘us effect of mutagens by excising the adduct and repairing the ‘genetic damage there are interindividual differences in dna repair capacity that have been shown to influence susceptibility to carcinogenesis at the poor end of the repair spectrum are ‘patients with xeroderma piginentosum who have defects in ex cision repair of uv photoproducts and extreme sensitivity 0 sunlightinduced skin carcinogenesis lung cancer risk may thus be defined by a variety of factors including the balance between metabolic activation and detox fication of tobacco carcinogen compounds as well as by the efficiency of dna repair the net effect of these processes isthe ‘carcinogendna adduct adducts then should bea valuable and relevant marker of biologically effective exposure over time as ‘wiencke etal 1 stat they represent an integrated measure of carcinogen exposure and metabolism dna repair capacity and cell mover ‘the report by wiencke et al 1 provides interesting and thoughtprovoking data suggesting an inverse association be ‘tween age at smoking initiation and aromatic dna adduct levels in the lung tissue of former smokers in contrast such a rel tionship was not evident in current smokers in whom smoking intensity was the variable best associated with adduct level ‘these differences were attributed to masking of the age effect in current smokers by their approximately twofold higher adduct levels the data in former smokers are in contrast with the pro file that fits that of the genetically susceptible individual who ‘could be expected to develop cancer at earlier ages andéor with fewer packyears of exposure than nonsusceptibe individuals in fact ryberg tal 2 found an inverse correlation between years fof smoking and adduct levels in patients with lung cancer le patients with higher adduct levels generally had a shorter dura tion of smoking andor lower smoking dose i would have been s7 editorials ieresting 0 evaluate these pattems in a smoking population ‘without lung cancer ‘the methods for measuring smokingrelated aromatic dna adducts are those used by many other laboratories however 00 thinlayer chromatographic autoradiograms are shown 1o enable ‘comparison of the chromatograms this is particularly important because its not clear whether the same adducts are being mea sured in current versus former smokers schoket et al 3 esi mated the apparent halflife for bulky dna adduets in the bron chial tissue to be 7 years in former smokers in the study by ‘wiencke etal 1 the former smokers had stopped smoking for fan average of 119 years genetic alterations ffom tobacco car cinogen exposure may persist in former smokers even in the presence of histologically normal appearing epithelium 451 ‘thus an area for more research is further elucidation of the kinetics of adduct removal ‘the potential mechanisms associated with the observation that dna adduct levels are higher in those patients who started smoking earlier are logical and based on knowledge of the fate of carcinogendna adducts studied in human cells and tissues and in animal model systems 67 if dna adduct accumulation is the mechanism for the observed age at smoking initiation effect then it would be very important to know in which cels of the tissue the dna adducts have accumulated one might not ‘expect dna adducts to accumulate in surrogate populations of cells to the same extent as in lung tissue ‘the authors show an excellent correlation between smoking related aromatic dna adducts in target lung tissue and blood ‘mononuclear cells these results are consistent with the authors earlier work and suggest that such cells may serve as a useful surrogate forthe lung target tissue this i an important finding although the use of blood monocytes as a surrogate remains controversial it can be hypothesized that dna repair capacity and level of cytogenetic damage in the lymphocytes reflect processes occur fing in the target organ this hypothesis needs to be further evaluated if we are to develop quantitative risk assessment mod cls for lung cancer the conduct of largescale population stud jes requires us to utilize readily accessible noninvasive tissues ‘analysis of the dna adduct levels in blood mononuclear cells ‘in celation to age at initiation of smoking would have been imeresting and might contribute to a mechanistic understanding of the process for example does the relationship between age at initiation of smoking and level of

abstract tobacco plants were genetically transformed with the gene encoding hepatitis b surface antigen hbsag linked to a nominally constitutive promoter enzymelinked immunoassays using a monoclonal antibody directed against hboman serumderived hbsag revealed the presence of hbsag im extracts of transformed leaves at levels that correlated with ‘mrna abundance this suggests that there were no major ‘inherent limitations of transcription or translation of this foreign gene in plans recombinant hbsag was purified from ‘transgenic plants by immunoaffinity chromatography and ex amined by electron microscopy spherical particles with an average diameter of 22 nm were observed in negatively stained preparations sedimentation of transgenic plant extracts in swerose and cesium chloride density gradients showed that the recombinant hbsag and human seruoderived hbsag had similar physical properties because the hbsag produced in transgenic plants is antigenically and physically similar to the hbsag particles derived from human serum and recombinant ‘yeast which are used as vaccines we conclude that transgenic plants hold promise as lowcost vaceine production systems hepatitis b virus infection is one of the most widespread viral infections of humans and causes acute and chronic hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma 1 the infectious viral particle dane particle isa 43nm doubleshelled sphere that consists of a core containing the 32kilobase kb dna genome ‘bound to the core protein surrounded by the viral envelope containing phospholipids and the major surface antigen hep atitis b surface antigen hbsag 2 in addition to dane particles the serum of infected individuals also contains 22nm subbvral particles in great excess over virions these ‘noninfectious particles contain the elements of the viral envelope including the major 24kda peptide that occurs in alycosylated and unglycosylated forms 2 ‘because the host range of hepatitis b virus is limited to humans and chimpanzees and since the virus cannot be propagated in cell culture hbsag for use in vaccines was purified from the serum of infected ingividuals until a recom binant form rhbsag was produced in yeast 3 the immu nogenic yeastderived rhbsag occurs in the form of spher ical particles with an average diameter of 17 nm integration ‘of the peptides into the phospholipidcontaining particles greatly enhances their immunogenic properties 4 subse quent work showed that the peptides present in the yeast derived particles were much less extensively disulfidelinked than ia the human material but that such linking could be induced in vitro 5 intramuscular injection of serumderived hbsag or yeast derived rhbsag in healthy individuals results in effective immunization and protection from viral

attempt the expression of hbsag in plants vith the hope of developing a less expen sive production system further we hope to find a way to present the rhbsax in edible plant tissues in a form that ‘would be useful as un oral vaccine in this paper we describe the transformation of bacco withthe gene encoding hbsag and its expression in leaf tissue in the form of an antigenic spherical particle

september 9 1982 to mr e j fackelman from k v mccaffrey re project aa with regards to your memo of september 2 let me say that while i dont disagree with the premise that imagery concepts are the most difficult to develop and refine on the down side i do feel that the upside of project aa has been completely overlooked 1 to put it in your words i view project aa as being corrective imagery and not compatible imagery if the designer name was calvin klein then i would say that aa is in a compatible image mode however yves saint laurant is a high fashion paris designer who is viewed as having distinctive sophisticated products which young adult female smokers want to be able to afford in their later years but cannot attain at this time ‘the strength that i see in project aa is a distinctive product coupled with a reinforcing image that could generate a very positive appeal this premise is based on womens return to femininity but i dont mean femininity in the traditional sense todays femininity includes not only physical attractiveness but also includes intelligence independence selfconfidence and the ability to successfully lead a full rich life the sexual  revolution is not part of todays 1824 year old woman they assume that all avenues of opportunity are open to them but they want to project themselves as attractive women not neuter gender 2 project aas main benefit to its target group is a cigarette that has a distinctively subtle taste not overpowering that is better than other brands on the market today the reason or support for why this cigarette is better is due to the designer name influence this influence causes expectations of a distinctive product that must be provided or consumers will feel they have been mislead as information a formal positioning statement will be issued the week of september 13 however the bottom line is a subtly distinctive product with a subtly distinctive image carrier 3 while it was known from the beginning that the odds of finding a solution to the 1824 year old corporate gap were minimal executive management felt that at least we might gain some usable consumer information therefore a rather rapid schedule was devised to not waste efforts if a solution did not appear quickly znee lnz0s,0

showed allelic loss at chromosome 17421 surprisingly only four of the 44 tumors studied were found to contain  mutation and in all cases the mutations were shown to bbe germline on the basis of these results they suggested that there could be a fundamental difference between the origin or sporadic tumors and those in genetically predisposed brca1 carriers the low frequency of somatic mutations in sporadic cases raised some suspicion as to the role of brca in the great majority of breast cancers and suggested the possiblity of yet another suppressor gene within the 17q21 region but outside the

pool of short fragment cdna libraries from adult brain adult testis etal brain spleen thymus and total fetus four overlapping yacs spanning a total of approximately 470 kb of genomic dna were used as

documented the enormous burden of disease and death that tobac co produces itis the current gener tion’s task to apply this knowledge reduce the morbidity and mortality caused by tobacco in this country and abroad these four books provide use ful background material for the job ahead the british journalist peter taylor has produced a briskly written book which summarizes the major scientific ‘economic and political realities of the tobacco industry the book begins with ‘an account of the scientific evidence that cigarettes cause cancer heart dis case and emphysema and bronchitis he relates this with the story of how the deta emerged in the major public hncalth reports on smoking and with sev eral anecdotes about the tobacco indus try’s own research on the health effects ‘of smoking several examples of the in dustry’ denial in the face of clear evi dence are presented the next chapter summarizes the major features of the great largely british and american tobacco com panies the origins and interconnec tions of the six largest multinational firms are presented ‘when taylor discusses the mass me dias habit of downplaying the relation ship of smoking and disease he pro vides a valuable behind the scenes ac count of his own 1976 documentary death in the west this film contrasts the stories of six men from the ameri ‘ean west who developed major ciga retteassociated diseases with promo tons for marlboro cigarettes and inter views with executives from marlboros ‘manufacturer philip morris the film undercuts the seductive appeal of ciga rette advertising philip morris suc ceeded in having the film removed from cireulation in great britain but copies have recently become available again death in the west has become part of several innovative schoolbased tobacco education programs ‘the remainder of taylors book con tains sometimes overlong accounts of the political maneuvering around ciga rettes and health in great britain and the united statesin recent years these case studies are nonetheless valuable the ability of the tobacco industry to gain amadvantage in arena after arena is impressive and taylor has docu mented many of the industrys tech nigues and approaches elizabeth whelan a public health worker i also concerned with the so cial political and economic aspects of the tobacco problem she shares with taylor the conviction that active sition from the tobacco industry and its supporters is the major reason that the abundant scientific evidence of harm from smoking has not yet led to effec tive control measures whelans book is organized into three parts the first three chapters outline the evidenee that tobacco is a major cause of disease and highlight 14 “ploys” that the tobacco industry has aeveloped in response to the medical 474 new york state journal of medicinejuly 1985 evidence this analysis should be help ful to people whose major information source on the subject has been the mass media all too often a news story con taining “bad” news about tobacco and disease is “balanced” with distracting and evasive comments from the tobac co institute ‘the major portion of the book is de voted to an historical narrative about the problem this provides a useful overview for instance cigarettes only became widely available with the per fection of mass production machinery in 1884 mass production itself gener ated the need for mass promotion ciga rette advertising has been an important part of the industry for as long as cig tettes have been produced by machine finally the third portion of

qxn 7s tot role of dna synthesis in secretion of immunoglobulin from murine b cells stimulated by t cell derived lymnphokines leigh g simpson ax peter c isakson from the department of pharmacology university of virgiula school of medicine charlottesvile va 22908 we have investigated whether cell division is re quired for induction of ig secretion from three types 4b cells which represent distinct activation states normal splenic b cells antilgtreated b ells and a monoclonal murine b cell tumor bcl1 polyclonal ig secretion was stimulated in vitro by 1psor by lymphokines produced by el4 cells el 4n which includes b cell growth factor 11 bcgf  lps and f14 sn were mitogenic for all three cell ‘pulations and stimulated substantial igm secre ion from both b cells and antilg blasts aphidi colin a reversible inhibitor of dna synthesis abol shed igm secretion from b cells and antitg blasts induced by either mitogen indicating that igsecret ing cells in these cultures are part of a cycling population bcl tumor cells respond to bcgf it but not to interleukin 2 or b cell stimulatory factor 1 with igm secretion and cell division allowing a direct assessment of the influence of bcgf ilstim ulated cell division on secretion of igm secretion by these cells during the first 24 hr of culture was not substantially affected by aphidicolin but secre tion at 48 or 72 hr was markedly inhibited culture of bcl cells for 48 hr with aphidicolin alone had no effect on cell viability or on subsequent respon siveness if the drug was removed eliminating non specific toxicity as an explanation of the drugs effect addition of aphidicolin during the last 24 hr of culture to either normal b cells or bcl cells was much less effective at inhibiting igm ‘secretion ‘these results indicate that the cells that secrete igm in response to bcgf il also synthesize dna when exposed to this factor thus induction of highrate ig secretion from murine b’cells by some stimuli including bcgf 11 may require at least one round of cell division during the course of an immune response in vivo b cells both proliferate and secrete immunoglobulin ig 1 tail the dependence of ig secretion upon cell division is tincertain initiation of cell division does not in itself activate ig secretion since some stimull are capable of inducing resting b cells to divide without secreting ig 2 4 this

813 original contributions localization of muscarinic receptor mrnas in rat heart and intrinsic cardiac ganglia by in situ hybridization donald b hoover ronald h baisden sylvia x ximoy abstract although the heart is considered relatively pure source of m2 muscarinic receptors the posible expression of ‘other muscarinic receplor genes at diserete sites within the myocardium of by intrinsic cardiac ganglia had not been ‘valued accordingly the resent sudy used in sit hybrid ization histochemistry with sslabeled oligonucleotide probes to address this issu initial experiments demonstrated thatthe localization of m2 mrna was similar to that reported for muscarinic receptors labeled withthe nonselective muscarinic antagonist guinuelidiny benaiate however there were two important exceptions the condvcting system contained less message than expected whereas the intrinsic cardiac ganglia contained more the mismatch between muscarinic recepior ‘and m2 mrna densities in the conducting system could not be ‘explained by the local expression of other muscarinic receptor genes since mi m3 and m4 mrnas were not detected at this uscarinic receptors located at a diversity of sites are known to contribute to the neuro regulation of cardiac fonction postjune tional cholinergic receptors on the myocardium have ‘been most thoroughly studied and can directly elicit negative chronotropic dromotropic or inotropic re sponses when uctivated by muscarinic agonists or the stimulation of cholinergic nerves muscarinic recep tors are also associated with cholinergic and adrenergic nerves in the heart these prejunctional receptors have an inhibitory influence on the release of acetyl choline and norepinephrine and presumably have a role in finetuning the amount of neurotransmitter available to interact with postjunctional receptors last musca rinic receptors are present on efferent neurons of the cardiac ganglia where they may have a role in modu lating ganglionic neurotransmission ‘an additional level of complexity has been added by the discovery of multiple muscarinic receptor subtypes five muscarinic receptor genes have been identified in molecular cloning experiments and the corresponding receptor proteins have been designated ml through m5 heterogeneity of muscarinic receptors has also been documented in functional and radioligand

detached by trypsinization the tyrosinephosphorylated state is re sgained within minutes when the cells are replated onto fibro nectia activation of fadk may be an important early step in intracelolar signal transduction pathways triggered in re sponse to cell interactions with the extracellular matrix ‘the metazoan proteinyrosine kinases ptks make up a large segment of the eukaryotic protein kinase superfamily 1 2and are known for their oncogenic potential as well as their roles in regulating aspects of normal development reviewed in refs 3 ptks are grouped into two broad structural classes on the basis of whether or not they span the plasma ‘membrane membranespanning ptks include receptors for various peptide growth and differentiation factors such as epidermal growth factor and plateletderived growth factor receptor ptk activity is stimulated upon ligand binding and subsequent receptor autophosphorylation followed by phos phorylation of exogenous substrates is an initial event in the signal transduction pathway reviewed in refs sand6 ptks that do not span the plasma membrane ie members of the sre subfamily have also been implicated in the transduction of extracellular signals that control cell growth and differen tiation reviewed in refs 79 given what is known about the widespread involvement of ptks in regulating developmental processes we sought t0 identify and characterize ptks with the ultimate goal of obtaining insight into how cells respond to environmental cues that influence their growth and differentiation in this feport we describe a

to killing by the fibrotropic strain of minute virus of mice lpacvovirus mvmp became sensitive to mvm when transformed by polyomay rus this sensitization did ‘nat involve an inerease in the pereentage of cells which synthesized viral capsid antigens or in the percentage of cells which produced infectious virus the addition of antimvm antiserum to the growth medium of ‘mvmginfected cells had only a small effect on theic survival rates indicating that the majority of the killing ifec of mvm occurs in a single cycle of infection the data indicate that cell killing by mvm is independent ‘of infectious virus production and thus support the notion that the preferential cytolytic effect is affected by ‘ral eylotoxic gene products which accumulate to intolerable levels in transformed cells but not in normal ones fi iy using cells transformed with polyom as and genomic and subgenomic clones of polyomavirus we showed that the extent of sensitization to killing by mvm depended on the transforming agent used certain parvoviruses possess the intriguing capability to destroy oncogenically transformed cells selectively in cule ture while having litle or no effect on the viability of the parental untransformed cells this preferential toxicity to transformed cells may account forthe inhibition of intuced tumorigenesis oncosuppression reported to occur in vivo 26 8 11 22 2527 a variety of ells have been used to study the preferential killing effect of autonomous parvoviruses these include tmouse 313 eels 1315 several at lroblast cel ines 13 and human rbroblasis and epithelial cells 34 a variety of transforming agents have also been used including simian virus 40 1 4 10 14 13 avian erythroblestosis vins 3 human rasoncogene 18 and radiation and chemical ca inogens 14 these studies show that the killing efect of transformed cells is dependent neither on the type of cell for on the transforming agent used and i the preferential killing of transformed cells is correlated with clevated expression of the viral genome in this study we invest faled the question of whether the production of infectious virus was required forthe selective iling effect of minute virus of mice mvm “the fischer rat embryo fibroblast cell line f11 chosen for this study is subject to astringent contact inhibition its anchorageindependent grovih i extremely low and it has  very typieal broblastc appearance these properties allow relatively easy isolation of cells with transformed pheno types 2 the flll and fl1uvpy polyomavirustrans formed f1l1 cell lines used in this study

growth rate was resumed in contrast the polyomavirusetransformed deriv ative cell lines were destroyed completely by mvmp infection within 24 h fig 1 the total yield of infectious virus produced in polyomavirustransformed cells was 10° to 10fold higher than that produced in similarly infected ‘untransformed cell lines table 1 this difference range in virus yield is comparable with those of other permissive restrictive systems for mvm 9 20 21 24 a subline of mouse lcells a9 which is used as a standard permissive cell line for mvmp was also included in all our experi ments for comparison table 1 shows that virus production in a9 cells was only slightly lower than in f111py cells to investigate the relationship between the killing effect and virus production cell killing during a single cycle of infection was quantitated by using an infectious center lassay this assay was performed as follows at 4 h post fection the cells were washed twice with phosphatebuffered saline to remove

to recd mays 182 ic interoffice memorandum tobacco cost reduction by modification date may 4 1982 of g13 blends dr j p dickerson from d p johnson a number of proposals have been made in previous memoranda for reducing rjr tobacco costs without sacrificing product quality ‘among these is a proposal to reduce the burley content of our blends since burley is the most expensive primary tobacco used to help accomplish this i recommend that consideration be given to changing the ratio of fluecured to burley in our g13 blends at present most of these blends contain three parts burley to one part fluecured since all of our cigarette blends contain 12 or more g13 this means that a minimum of about 37 of our burley is puffed although puffed burley retains much of its  normal smoking character it nevertheless is altered and its impact is reduced this coupled with the fact that about 40 of our burley also is denicotinized probably demands a higher percentage of burley in our blends to achieve the desired flavor level two factors contributed to the initial decision to adopt a high burley blend for puffing first puffing imparts a significantly lighter color to tobacco and puffed fluecured pecially conspicuous in the cigarette filler thus burley with its naturally dark color was chosen and initially it was the only type puffed secondly fluecured tobacco retains considerably higher levels of residual freon than cased burley and additional information was needed on the rate of dissipation of freon and its fate during the burning process ‘this question has since been answered and concern for both factors has abated there fore if the burley to fluecured ratio in the g13 blends could be changed to a high level of fluecured and a low level of burley perhaps a reduction in total burley could be made and an overall cost reduction realized recently a high fluecuredlow burley g13 blend has been adopted for the ultra low tar brands because of the high levels of g13 in these products however these brands represent a relatively small percentage of our total production a secondary but very important benefit to be gained by reversing the tobacco ratio is improved product uniformity g13 is com bined with the remainder of the blend in the top dressing drum and in spite of manufacturings best efforts uniform blending is not always achieved bege lzeos iri form 2422rev 770,0

v hee 1108 vol 9 workers can be ‘bribed’ to live healthy lifestyles conference told chicago — by a bna staff correspondent — for the right price workers can be bribed to quit ‘smoking exercise lower their cholesterol levels and engage in other healthy behavior a consulting actuary told a wellness conference here “lets face it money is a motivator—even if its 10 bucks a month” said stephen brink principal and consulting actuary for milliman  robertson inc at the worksite wellness council of greater chicagos wellbusiness 2000 conference on sept 26 “as actu aries we know that people who have 100 deductibles use their health benefits more than those with higher deductibles finances are a motivator” ‘the practice of using financial incentives and disin centives to healthy behavior such as dis counted and inflated deductibles and cash gifts is still in the experimental stages but is gaining in popular ity according to brink only about 2 percent of the nation’s companies have instituted such programs which grew out of wellness programs in place at about 80 percent of us companies he said ither by using a disincentive approach—taking money away—or an incentive agenda—providing cash gifts—an increasing number of employers are trying to help their workers control weight lower blood pressure reduce stress promote mental health and cut down on back problems brink said evidence is scarce on the amount of money that such programs are saving companies brink said however evidence does show that the programs are influencing health behavior he added one of milliman  robertsons clients execufit of san francisco used incentive programs to cut high risk smoking behavior by 50 percent moved 20 per ccent of high blood pressure sufferers into a low risk category and moved 10 percent of participants af filcted with weight problems and high cholesterol into lowrisk groups brink said some companies aod state employers who have launched similar programs include adolph coors co foldcraft hershey foods corp the kansas state gov ‘ernment southern california edison co sara lee corp and lutheran health systems the programs range from focusing on one or two health problems to ‘a wider array of health behavior brink said these involve giving employees monthly cash gifts of between 5 and 10 for maintaining healthier life styles to penalizing workers by increasing deductibles up to 900 annually for failing to achieve health goals he said “positive incentives seem to work better than nega tive incentives but there is no conclusive evidence data on which works better” brink said i personally think positive incentives work better than disincen tives programs” he added ‘any relatively common highrisk behavior that can be measured and changed is a candidate for an incen tive program brink asserted 101 pwn ate © of tee pawo bna’s employee relations weekly in brief msha to bold bearings on hazard standard the mine safety and health administration will hold pub lic

uptake pma and the ayvadrenergic agonist guanabenz both induced cotransport with a stoichiometry of 2 cl1 na and 2 cl1 rb and elevated staurosporinesensitive pkc activity in cytosolic and particu late fractions prolonged pma treatment did not sustain bumetanidesensitive 2 cl1 na and 2 cl1 rb transport but did block stimulation of bumotanidesensitive transport by pmaor guanabent and elevation of pkc activity by pma and guanabenz in a particulate fraction cells treated with oka daic acid exhibited a staurosporine and bumetanidesensi tive 2 cl1 na and 2 cl rb uptake in cultured monolayers

secretory cells in a reconstituted tracheal epithelium pretreatment of transmonolayer cul ‘tures with pma diminished the stimulatory response to epinephrine these results indicate that in rabbit tracheal epithelial cells aadrenergic stimulation activated na2c1k at pkg is a critical effector in this process ‘aadrenergic receptors loop diuretics bumetanide protein phosphatase guanabenz epinephrine clonidine transmono layer cultures staurosporine protein kinase c ‘one mode of transporting the electrolytes na and cl ‘that is common to many cell types is cotransport of the electrolytes na and cl which is directly coupled to the inwardly directed na electrochemical gradient as the driving force for cl uptake an additional requirement for k is seen in some cells under specific stimulatory conditions such as for example vasopressin stimula tion of mouse medullary thick ascending limb 82 we have previously shown that nacl cotransport in hu man and rabbit tracheal epithelial cells is activated by aadrenergic agonists 15 and hyperosmotic challenge 16 the ca ionophore ionomycin mimics the response tooadrenergie stimulation other studies show second ary activation of cotransport in canine tracheal epithe lial cells which is mediated by agents that stimulate cal cl channels to induce cl secretion 10 11 these studies correlated stimulation of salt secretion by isopro terenol atp and utp to the equilibrium level of saturable basolateral bumetanidebinding sites the caa8 finding of increased bumetanide binding with induction of cl secretion was interpreted as upregulation of cotransport in cl secretory cells our finding of direct activation of cotransport by a adenosine 35eyclic monophosphate campindepen dent mechanism led to detailed studies of the intracel lular signaling of the aadrenergic stimulation the studies first focused on effectors involved in cadependent mecha nisms for signal transduction the results demonstrate aadrenergic activation of phosphatidylinositol 45 bisphosphate ptdins45pzspecific phospholipase c with subsequent hydrolysis of ptdine45p to two intracellular second messengers inositol phosphate 17 and diacylglycerol 18 the transient nature of mediator release within a time frame that coincides with cotransporter activation suggested a link between ca and diacylglycerol these two intracellular media tors are activators for some isotypes of protein kinase c pkc ref 31 pkc subsumes a family of at least 10 subtypes some of which require ca for activation 26 31 pkc has been linked to the regulation of other electrolyte trans porters including cation and anion exchangers that operate during cell volume regulation salt absorption and ph regulation and ion channels that are required for secretion in particular an apical cl channel 2 46 ‘a useful tool in identifying and characterizing pkc regulation is phorbol 12myristate 13acetate pma phorbol ester that activates pkc 31 the effects pma often show a time dependence that is interpreted as resulting from activation early or downregulation cate of pkc for example with some ion exchangers such as nah or cvhco of thyroid and vero cells respectively shortterm treatment with pma acti vates ion exchange whereas longterm treatment with pma which chronically activates pkc fails to alter electrolyte transport through ion exchangers 22 34 in the latter instance chronic activation of pkc leads ‘to downregulation due to increased sensitivity to prote lysis 81 shortterm pma treatment can induce opposing responses as seen in intestinal and renal epithelial cells 35 in these cells neh exchangers found on apical membranes are inhibited by pma which produces an opposite effect of stimulation on cation exchangers in the basolateral surface pma also influences the activity of naclk eotrans porters in epithelial and nonepithelial cells fibro blasts 27 30 endothelial cells 26 and osteoblasts 88 express a cotransporter that is sensitive to

for the maintenance ‘of homeostasis recent investigations from our group into the regulation of human neutrophil pmn phagocytosis have led us to hypothesize that phagocytosis by pmn is primarily a

reflected not only in the total numberof ingested targets but also in the percentage of pmn participating in the phagocytic process 12 presum ably this regulation of ingestion acts to limit the damsging products of pmn activation such as toxic oxygen metabolites and sereted lysosomal products tothe ste of inflammation ‘we and others have found that pmn can recruit several istnet molecular mechanisms for phagocytosisin response to inflammatory signals which may be regulated further by the specific opsonin igg cab c3 and c3 and opsonin recep torferil feriit cr and cr3 engaged 19 in addition ‘monocytes and macrophages employ quite different molecular rechanisms for phagocytosis from those employed by pmn ‘even when the same opsonin or opsonin receptor is involved 1 10 in this manner at inflammatory sites where pmn and macrophages encounter proinflammatory cytokines interfr ‘ons interleukins chemotactic peptides and components of ion isnot only augmented but ‘the molecular mechanism involved in phagocytosis may be alteced asan example we have shown recently that ingestion of igg opsonized targets by nonstimulated pmn is not depe dent upon protein kinase cpkc activation however when pmn are simulated with tumor necrosis factor tnf2 not only is ingestion ofthe iggopsonized targets markedly increased but pkc translocation is also greatly augmented over the minimal amount observed with either igg or tnf« alone 11 this synergism inactivation of pkc is essential for the increased ingestion by pmn exposed to tnfa 11 the jmportance ofthese dat tohost defense is

title tobacco restriction today what tomorrow byline joe hawkins credit special to the banner est pages 2  010596 nshv22827 nashville banner nshv section news page al3 copyright 1996 column community voices there is an issue currently facing tennesseans and their agricultural heritage that is much more complex than would be realized at first glance the issue is that of regulatory jurisdiction of tobaccorelated products for those tennesseans not involved in agriculture production or nontobacce users the issue vould seem even more insignificant than however this is an issue of tremendous importance to last year the us food and drug administration fda announced a farreaching plan to exercise regulatory control over the marketing and sale of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco the foundation for this action is based on the fda assumption that tobacco products are a delivery device of nicotine two major concerns arise from this regulatory initiative while the antitobacco forces of todays society argue that the tobacco issue should be addressed without regard to economics it is unrealistic to do so economics cannot be disregarded for it is the very purpose of the production process tobacco producers do not grow tebacco to create a ‘‘drug delivery system tebacco producers grow tobacco in order to pay the bills that in turn help maintain other business activity production has through the years passed on a strong work ethic an ability to provide for a family on limited production resources land significant economic benefit to the local state and federal tax revenue it has clothed fed and educated a significant number of tennesseans it is interesting to note that tennessee passed a temporary tax in 1925 on tobacco products to fund education that tax was made permanent in 1927 and in 1994 resulted in an excess of 84 million for education no other product can compete with that contribution just as no other product can offer the return on investment to the producer if the demand for any product provided the production incentive of tobacco producers would respond alternative crops are often suggested however if a major shift to any other production was successful without major marketing network changes for that production chaos and bankruptcy would be the result for many aside from economics another major concern arises from this fda ti16860058,9
