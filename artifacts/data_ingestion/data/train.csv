v hee 1108 vol 9 workers can be ‘bribed’ to live healthy lifestyles conference told chicago — by a bna staff correspondent — for the right price workers can be bribed to quit ‘smoking exercise lower their cholesterol levels and engage in other healthy behavior a consulting actuary told a wellness conference here “lets face it money is a motivator—even if its 10 bucks a month” said stephen brink principal and consulting actuary for milliman  robertson inc at the worksite wellness council of greater chicagos wellbusiness 2000 conference on sept 26 “as actu aries we know that people who have 100 deductibles use their health benefits more than those with higher deductibles finances are a motivator” ‘the practice of using financial incentives and disin centives to healthy behavior such as dis counted and inflated deductibles and cash gifts is still in the experimental stages but is gaining in popular ity according to brink only about 2 percent of the nation’s companies have instituted such programs which grew out of wellness programs in place at about 80 percent of us companies he said ither by using a disincentive approach—taking money away—or an incentive agenda—providing cash gifts—an increasing number of employers are trying to help their workers control weight lower blood pressure reduce stress promote mental health and cut down on back problems brink said evidence is scarce on the amount of money that such programs are saving companies brink said however evidence does show that the programs are influencing health behavior he added one of milliman  robertsons clients execufit of san francisco used incentive programs to cut high risk smoking behavior by 50 percent moved 20 per ccent of high blood pressure sufferers into a low risk category and moved 10 percent of participants af filcted with weight problems and high cholesterol into lowrisk groups brink said some companies aod state employers who have launched similar programs include adolph coors co foldcraft hershey foods corp the kansas state gov ‘ernment southern california edison co sara lee corp and lutheran health systems the programs range from focusing on one or two health problems to ‘a wider array of health behavior brink said these involve giving employees monthly cash gifts of between 5 and 10 for maintaining healthier life styles to penalizing workers by increasing deductibles up to 900 annually for failing to achieve health goals he said “positive incentives seem to work better than nega tive incentives but there is no conclusive evidence data on which works better” brink said i personally think positive incentives work better than disincen tives programs” he added ‘any relatively common highrisk behavior that can be measured and changed is a candidate for an incen tive program brink asserted 101 pwn ate © of tee pawo bna’s employee relations weekly in brief msha to bold bearings on hazard standard the mine safety and health administration will hold pub lic

effect of activin a on globin gene expression in purified human erythroid progenitors by lien shao normand l gon jr arlene l young alice l yu lawrence s mathews joan vaughan wylie vale and john yu ‘the regulatory control of human erythropoiesis through a purified protein activin a was examined previous studios ing mixed populations of bone marrow calls suggested that activin  has an indirect effect on cellular proliferation ‘and dna synthesis of erythroid progenitors through the ‘mediation of accessory cells in prosent studies the cultures ‘of purified erythroid progenitors were used to examine the ‘effect of activin a on globin gene expression human ery throid burstforming units bfue were partially purified ‘rom priharal ond ated consisted mainly of erythroid colonyforming units crue t wes found that the subsequent 7day cultures of ‘these purified progenitors yielded similar numbers and size listributions of erythroid colonies regardless of the pres ‘ence of activin ain the cultures in addition these erythroid progenitor cells wore responsi dna synthesis to the addition of erythropoietin but ‘treatment by activin a therefore once the erythroid pr astivin § was fin pure to tomogenty rom ‘gonadal fluids and shown to stimulate the secretion of pituitary folictestimulating hormone’ it was found that activin a could modulate the colony formation of erythroid bburstforming units bfue and erythroid colonyforming units cfue in human bone marrow culture’ and could also induce human ks62 and mouse friend cells to become positively stained by benzidine recently a protein that exhibited this inducing activity toward friend cells was isolated from human thp1 cells and found to be identical with activin a because it was encoded by the same mrna a that of activin a in addition it was found that this ‘protein was expressed atleast at the rna level in the bone ‘arrows of rats these data all suggest a possible role of activin a in the regulatory control of erythropoiesis” however mechanisms of the action of activin a on the process of erythropoiesis remain largely unknown twas reported that activin a increases the proliferative state of erythroid progenitors from both bone marrow and peripheral blood and that this effect on erythroid cell proliferation is exerted indirectly ie through mediation of both monocytes and t lymphocytes it was also suggested that activin a may drive immature erythroid precursors to form hemoglobinized cells thereby rendering the colonies recognizable as erythroid colonies’ conceivably activin ‘a may have effects on both cellular proliferation and ‘enthroid differentiation in the accompanying report activin a was found to induce accumulation of hemoglobins and stimulate the many globin transcripts in ks62 cells unlike our previous studies using mixed populations of hematopoietic ecll the present investigations address the issues of the effects of activin a on highly purified preparations of human erythroid progenitors in contrast ro the studies reported in the accompanying article that used the k562 cell line as a model” the culture of partially purified human erythroid progenitors in present

hematology ropoiesisin vitro twas found that activin a directly affects the levels of globin mrnas and hemoglobins in developing human erythroid calls it was also found that both purified erythroid

7— which side are you on should teenagers start smoking to smoke or not to smoke that’s the question many people are asking themselves these days they know it might be a matter of life and death to them and its no secret that some of these people arent any older than you our information for the “no” side was obtained by interviewing a man who quit smoking three years ago after puffing two packs a day for 15 years we couldnt think of any arguments for the “yes” side can you which side are you on the fun and pleasure of ‘not smoking far outweigh the pleasure of two packs  day the nonsmoker enjoys food so much more he has more en ergy to do things that are much more satisfying than puffing a weed he sleeps more soundly ‘he usually doesn’t catch as many ‘colds he doesn’t get winded as easily and so can do better in sports usually he doesn’t annoy himself and others with a rasp ing cough in the morning his mouth does not taste like the in side of an old pair of gloves he is calmer more poised more con fident than many smokers ‘the nonsmoker saves money —as much as 200 a year ‘and don’t forget that a mere two or three cigarettes a day fre quently lead to two or three packs a day ‘but there is a much more ser ious reason for not smoking cig arettes ‘they can kill you no victim of the stabbing pain of lung cancer would be likely to advise you to smoke the smoker ‘also has more reason to fear heart attacks and diseases that attack the lungs such as bron chitis and emphysema the death rate for men who began smok ing when they were teenagers is 100 percent higher than that of nonsmokers °as a nonsmoker you can hope for a longer life filled with the real pleasures of not smoking ‘and your growing confidence and poise will spring not from ‘the flimsy crutch of nicotine but from you  young cathol messencen dayton ohio we 808300 mar4 1365 timn 280272,9

just rom the american can ‘cer society sponsor of the annual event but also from businesses worksites and restaurants some 5 million smokers went 24 hours with ‘out lighting up during last years smokeout the idea is to experience being smokefree for one day “even if its just to prove to themselves that they can doit” saysa bulletin from the american cancer society if some smokers try it like it and never light up again well then all the better they can join the ‘welling ranks of former smokers—at last count ‘some 35 million people have kicked the habit since 1964 the date of the landmark surgeon generals report linking cigarettes to cancer ‘theres no need to elaborate on all the health benefits of quitting the risk of lung cancer em  physema the higher incidence of cancer of the

cigarette burns a carpet and furniture  ‘they also know the cost not just the 125 a‘ ‘pack but the extra time lost from work smok ers have more colds than nonsmokers and their children have more inner ear infections than chil dren who live in a smokefree bome and there is growing evidence that the nonsmoking spouses ‘of smokers have higher rates of heart and lung  diseases 2    smokers’are

inited to “out of doors ‘businesses are also jumping on the antismidk ing bandwagon by restricting smoking to certain areas and sometimes banning it altogether from the worksite one firm warned

leukemic cells are much more susceptible to the photosensitizing effect of pi than normal bone marrow bm a 4log reduction in the number of clonogenic leukemic cells was achieved under conditions ‘where colony formation by normal hemopoietic progenitors was reduced by 40 moreover the results of irradiating ‘mixed populations of leukemic and normal cells indicated that phototoxicity of leukemic cells was not affected by the presence of a large excess of normal bm cells nor was the survival of normal bm cells influenced by the presence of leukemic cells these findings suggested that the procedure ‘could be adapted for selective ex vivo elimination of malig nantcellsi¢purging of bm in remission prior to autologous transplantation key words purging — autologous bone matrow transplantation photodyoamic therapy methods for purging neoplastic cells from harvested marrow are being developed to increase the efficacy of autologous ‘bone marrow bm transplantation 13 one approach is selective photosensitization using sensitizing compounds and fight radiation 4 5 the variety of compounds shown to exert  photosensitizing effect includes the hematoporphy ‘ins phuthlocyanines and meroeyanines 68 these well studied fluorescent compounds are taken up preferentially by tumor ceils and undergo photoexcitation when exposed toappropriate nonionizing radiation we have recently shown that 12lpyreneytodecanoie acid p12 fatty acd to which 1 pyrene ring has becn covalently linked isan eficent and selective photosensitizing agent 9 among the various py renecontaining fatty acids studied p12 was most effectively transported across the cell membrane and subsequently in ‘corporated into the cells neutraland phospholipids 10 11 celis of different types and stages of maturation were found to vary in their rate of p12 uptake and incorporation 12 incubation of cells with p12 followed by irradiation with longwave uv light luv at 366 nm resulted in cellular “ares ofr requ 1 dt eibach depa of hem cia ei givers hospi po bor 300 jee su 50588593 toxicity which was related to the intensity of irradiation as ‘well as fo the rateand extent of p12 uptake 9 13 the latter could be influenced by modifying the incubation conditions such as p12 concentration addition of serum albumin in clusion of ronfluorescent fatty acids or changing the tem perature 1 consequently all these parameters also af fected phoosensitization of the cells the procedure proved tobe efficient in selectively eliminating certain cell types and sparing other more cesistant cells 9 the higher sensitivity of some undifferentiated leukemic cells as compared with theiedifercatiated nomleukemic progeny suggested that this procedure might be utilized for selective

vol 21 no 78 november 23 1999 reynolds tobacco lauds legal victory in minnesota class action in another important legal victory for the tobacco industry a federal court in minnesota has denied cenification of a classaction suit secking smoking cessation and medical monitoring programs for smokers and former smokers in minnesota “federal courts have unanimously rejected certification of tobacco class actions” said thomas p mckim assistant general counsc of rj reynolds tobacco company “the ruling marks the 10” time that a federal court has rejected this type of case since 1997 we are very pleased that sound legal reasoning as well as judicial common sense have once again prevailed” in denying certification in janet thompson et al v american tobacco company inc et al the uss district court for the district of minnesota noted “in the present case this analysis reveals that piaintiffs’ complaint is riddled with individual questions that predominate over questions ‘common to the class” in its 26page opinion the court also said  “plaintiffs argue that this case can be decided without regard to the conduct or condition of plaintiffs in other words plaintiffs seek to avoid any question as to their own personal responsibility in this matter by shifting focus to the conduct of defendants although establishing that defendants’ conduct was fraudulent is necessary to the determination of this claim the conduct and condition of each plaintiff must also be considered each time the conduct or condition of plaintiffs arises an individualized inquiry must be undertaken the first such instance is proof of individual injury its clear that in order to sustain this lawsuit plaintiffs must have suffered some injury as a result of defendants’ conduct” page 18  “plaintiffs contend that proof of injury can be established on a classwide basis without engaging in individualized inquiries of each plaintiff defendants argue that both addiction and increased risk of disease cannot be proven unless an individualized inquiry is undertaken ‘the court agrees with defendants” page 19  “therefore in onder to prove injury in this case each plaintiff must establish an addiction to cigarettes with a class of approximately 700000 individuals the assessment necessary to make such  finding would be impracticable and unmanageable and would certainly predominate over questions common to the class” page 21 rjro000001531099914 70029 3778 9l9b seszs,2

and the japanese negotiators were not tangoing” 1e said “i was getting tired of negotiating with myself” japanese offer ‘the trade representative explained that sato had offered to remove javanese quotas on beef over three years increasing the quota levels—to let in more goods—by 10 perceni annually and then eliminating them entirely in the fifth year for citrus the japa nese had offered to remove quotas after five years ‘yeutter explained tat the united states would have been willing to accep the threeyear removal of beef quotas but that the japanese had also wanted to impose a type of import surcharge on us beef in exchange for the tariff removal yeutter said he could not accept this offer because although the quotas would be removed the price constraints “could be just as onerous” as what was originally in place he said with regard to citras yeutter said that he was not willing to accept a fveyear tariff removal without compensation for the us citrus industry “what we had offered was two years with anything over that including a patience payment” which he explained is a compensatory payinent agreed to prior to a gatt ruling “we felt that live years was far too long” he added at the press confcrence agriculture department officials circulated a statement from agriculture sec retary richard lyng who is currently in fallbrook calif in the statement lyng said that he was “extemely disappointd” that an agreement had not been reached and tiat he had supported yeutters efforts toward a resolution  advertising health officials urge congress to restrict cigarette advertising charge deception representatives of “public health groups may 4 urged a house subconnittee to push ahead with pro posed legislation hr 1532 hr 3294 to restrict or ban cigarette advertising charging that ads for lowtar and lownicotine produets are deceptive  ‘tobacco companies ‘are consciously deceiving the public by using their advertising to lull smokers into believing that socalle4 “light” cigarettes— those con taining lower levels of tar and nicotine—are safeto smoke although there is no medical evidence that light cigarettes pose less uf a health hazard the public health officials charged  “consumers who piichase lowtar and lownicotine cigarettes believing that they are substantially redue ing their risk of heart disease chronic obstructive lung disease or cance are seriously mistaken” said dr alfred munzeroi the coalition on smoking or health—composed of the american heart associ regulation economics and law der 5588 ation american lung association and american can cer society—told the house energy and commerce transportation ‘tourism and hazardous materials subcommittee “advertisements which promote these cigarettes directly or indirectly as significantly safer alternatives are patently false” ° dr robert e medfee of the american medical association noted that while tobacco companies are touting the health benefits of light cigarettes in their advertising medical studies show many smokers of light cigareites end up getting about the same doses of tar and nicotine as smokers of regular cigarettes because they tend to inhale more deeply and smoke more cigarettes “there is no safe cigarette and no safe level of tobacco consumption” he said mcafee charged that advertisements for light ciga rettes are confusing if not outright deceptive for ‘example he said cigarette makers use such labelling terms as “low tar” “lower tar” “ultra low tar “lights” and “ultra’ lights” which are industry desig nations with no legal or medical meaning such terms are “misleading and are applied to many brands ‘which do not provide lower doses of tar and nicotine” he said scott d ballin vice president for public affairs for the coalition on smoking or health charged that the federal trade commission has failed to take action against deceptive low tar and nicotine advertise ments ballin said that the coalition supports hr 3294 which’ would require “that cigarette ‘advertising be regulated under food and drug administration mat keting guidelines for legal drugs  me ftc testimony consumers are better servedby an unregulated advertising environment since they are likely to bs exposed to more information that way fc chairman daniel oliver argued as long as the information on tar and nicotine content is accurate advertisements promoting light cigarettes “can be a’ valuable source of information to consumers” he said if the advertis ing is deceptive the ftc will take action against the company he added we subcommittee chairman rep thomas luken d ohio and ranking minority member bob whittaker rkan—who previously introduced hr 3294 and hr 1582 which would impose a total ban on cigarette advertising—said that they are working on another bill which would allow states torequire more strin gent health warnings than federal law ‘requires tt ‘would also permit plaintiffs to bring” suit against cigarette companies even if the companies complied with federal warnings and it would require the ftc to contract with either a government or private labora tory to conduct annual studies of tar and nicotine levels the laboratory would also collect data on the average levels of other chemicals commonly found in cigarettes including carbon monoxide ammonia cya nide formaldehyde and radioactive compounds the

biology elizabeth pennisi reports from sarasoa fla atthe annual meeting ofthe association for chemoreception sciences foods that fool the body with low fat nutritionists and food companies may have more success promoting healthy diets if they concentrate on reducing fat in specific foods unfortunately ice cream isnt one of them people can judge the fat content of milkbased products ‘much more easily than the fat in mixed foods such as chicken salad report beverly j tepper and susan e shaffer of rutgers university in new brunswick n ‘tepper and shaffer tested the ability of 73 people to judge the richness of various foods each person visited the research lab twice weekly for two weeks at each five versions of six common foods the looked and tasted the same but varied in fat content and texture inone est participants judged the relative fat contents of the different versions by comparing them to one another in another test conducted ona different day they estimated théfat content of each version separately in neither test could participants accurately judge the fat content of scrambled eggs or chicken spread tepper says but in both tests they succeeded in ranking mashed potatoes and pudding — two milkbased foods they also distinguished the telative richness of crunchy snacks fried in different oils “in some foods people are going to notice the difference in fat content butin others you can make relatively large ‘changes without people noticing” tepper concludes alzheimer’s disease does the nose know an insidious disease alzheimer’s can start to develop long before one can detect troublesome losses in cognitive function however people with this disease also lose some of their sense ‘of smell researchers hope that monitoring changes in this sense will help them detect the disease earlier and aid in tracking its progression “the goal is to develop an early marker or something that ‘could change along with the disease” explains jack pearl of the national institute on deafness and other communication disorders in bethesda md “an olfactory test is a relatively noninvasive way of testing” ‘toward that end several research groups have begun studying the ability of older people with and without alzheim es to detect and remember odors ina study conducted at the university of california san diego medical center 65 people with alzheimer’s disease and ‘82 healthy people of similar ages and backgrounds underwent vision taste and odor tests the vision and taste components helped the scientists determine whether the participants were ‘of sound enough mind for testing and whether deterioration had occurred in more than one sensé ‘one of the odor tests required participants to sniff alcohol from pairs of plastic squeeze bottles and pick out the one with the stronger scent by supplying bottles with different concen trations of alcohol the researchers could tell at what concen tration the person first detected the odor the same people also sipped sugar water samples with differing degrees of sweet ness and were asked to spit out the sweeter one participants with alzheimer’s needed much stronger odors than the healthy sniffers say claire murphy and steven nordin who led the study “the more demented the person the higher the threshold but there was no such correlation for taste adds nordin “the research suggests there isa specific detection dysfunction to odors” furthermore he notes in the seven people with alzheimer’s disease who have now been tested for three years the average yearly change in the odordetection threshold has correlated with the progression of dementi a second experiment assessed the participants’ ability to recognize odors they had smelled earlier each person looked 300 at 10 faces of presidents and 10 engineering symbols and ‘smelled 10 common household odors they then examined a second set of faces symbols and odors half of which came from the first set participants tended to score the same when rating familiar faces and symbols as when rating odors they had sniffed earlier but alzheimers patients scored lower ‘overall indicating a general decline in memory says nordin at duke university in durham nc psychologist susan s ‘schiffman and her colleagues track changes in healthy people ‘who are at risk of developing alzheimer’s so far the study involves 22 such individuals and 22 people matched for age ‘gender race level of education and handedness who are not ‘considered at risk or the disease participants undergo several tests including ones in which they pick the stronger of two flavors or odors and are asked to remember familiar ones ‘the twogroups differ only intheirability toremember odors reports brevick g graham of duke “i wouldnt suggest that odor testing would ever replace any ‘of the cognitive measures but it might be used in addition to ‘other things for early diagnosis of alzheimer’s” he says theres no accounting for taste countless studies have indicated that animals avoid bitter foods but some actually prefer acrid flavors reports john 1 glendinning of the university of arizona in tucson while glendinning was at florida state university in tal lahassee he studied the eating habits of two species of wild mexican mice he discovered that while none of the peromyscus ‘melanotismice liked bitter flavors seven of 64 peromyscus azteca mice preferred quinine water over regular water he then offered both species hop extract tannic acid and two other bitter ‘substances “these chemicals are realy different bt neverthe less they all elicit similar responses” glendinning told science news “individuals that prefer quinine were more likely to prefer ‘other bitter chemicals” up to a certain concentration glendinning calls this the “schweppes effec” after the tonic water that some people prefer over regular water citing other studies showing that some goats opossums and squirrel monkeys like bitter foods he suggests that many animals ‘exhibit this effect although he doesnt really know why he suspects however that in foods — particularly plants — bitterness may reflect higher nutritional content how sweet a protein can be ‘a reddish fruit sold in nigerian markets has provided scientists with yet another supersweet protein ounce per ‘ounce this s2aminoacld protein called brazzein provides 2000 times the sweetness of sugar reports ding ming  biochemist atthe university of wisconsinmadison he and wisconsin colleague gran hellekant isolated the protein from pantadiplandra brazzeana a vine plant that produces a fruit slightly bigger than a grape “the sugar content isnot that high we guess thatthe sweet protein plays the same role as sugar” says ming sweetness may encourage animals to eat such fruits and help disperse seeds he explains brazzeins lysinerich amino acid sequence beats tittle resemblance to those of other sweet proteins sn 51990 315 which tend to contain many more amino acids says ming this protein also proves quite stable surviving 98°c temperatures for at least two hours and’ maintaining its sweetness in a wide range of acidic and alkaline solutions the researchers report moreover electrical recordings from taste ‘nerves of primates reveal thatthe protein elicits a purely sweet sensation with no aftertaste the wisconsin scientists have applied for a patent for the protein ‘science news vol 143

————— editorials molecular dosimeters of siioking damage in the lung 2073736740 margaret r spitz mariza de andrade john di giovanni ‘traditional epidemiologic research relied on selfreported ‘measures of “extemal exposure” in defining the association be tween cigarette smoking and cancer risk with elucidation of carcinogeninduced geneuic and epigenetic events knowledge of the molecular etiology of smokingrelated cancers has expanded rapidly and has facilitated the study of tobacco carcinogenesis the dose of tobacco carcinogens to which lung tissue is ex posed is modulated by genetic polymorphisms in the enzymes responsible for activation phase 1 and detoxification phase fl of tobacco carcinogens for example the cytochromes p50 multigene superfamily of enzymes is involved in phase i oxida tive processes that may create intermediates that are more reac tive than the parent compounds and can be carcinogenic or mu tagenic phase ti metabolic processes generally inactivate these genotoxic compounds through conjugation that promotes cellu lar excretion the activated intermediates covalently bind 10 dna and form carcinogenmacromolecular adducts indispens able for maintaining genomic imegrity and fidelity ae the dna repair mechanisms that protect cellular dna from the deleteri ‘us effect of mutagens by excising the adduct and repairing the ‘genetic damage there are interindividual differences in dna repair capacity that have been shown to influence susceptibility to carcinogenesis at the poor end of the repair spectrum are ‘patients with xeroderma piginentosum who have defects in ex cision repair of uv photoproducts and extreme sensitivity 0 sunlightinduced skin carcinogenesis lung cancer risk may thus be defined by a variety of factors including the balance between metabolic activation and detox fication of tobacco carcinogen compounds as well as by the efficiency of dna repair the net effect of these processes isthe ‘carcinogendna adduct adducts then should bea valuable and relevant marker of biologically effective exposure over time as ‘wiencke etal 1 stat they represent an integrated measure of carcinogen exposure and metabolism dna repair capacity and cell mover ‘the report by wiencke et al 1 provides interesting and thoughtprovoking data suggesting an inverse association be ‘tween age at smoking initiation and aromatic dna adduct levels in the lung tissue of former smokers in contrast such a rel tionship was not evident in current smokers in whom smoking intensity was the variable best associated with adduct level ‘these differences were attributed to masking of the age effect in current smokers by their approximately twofold higher adduct levels the data in former smokers are in contrast with the pro file that fits that of the genetically susceptible individual who ‘could be expected to develop cancer at earlier ages andéor with fewer packyears of exposure than nonsusceptibe individuals in fact ryberg tal 2 found an inverse correlation between years fof smoking and adduct levels in patients with lung cancer le patients with higher adduct levels generally had a shorter dura tion of smoking andor lower smoking dose i would have been s7 editorials ieresting 0 evaluate these pattems in a smoking population ‘without lung cancer ‘the methods for measuring smokingrelated aromatic dna adducts are those used by many other laboratories however 00 thinlayer chromatographic autoradiograms are shown 1o enable ‘comparison of the chromatograms this is particularly important because its not clear whether the same adducts are being mea sured in current versus former smokers schoket et al 3 esi mated the apparent halflife for bulky dna adduets in the bron chial tissue to be 7 years in former smokers in the study by ‘wiencke etal 1 the former smokers had stopped smoking for fan average of 119 years genetic alterations ffom tobacco car cinogen exposure may persist in former smokers even in the presence of histologically normal appearing epithelium 451 ‘thus an area for more research is further elucidation of the kinetics of adduct removal ‘the potential mechanisms associated with the observation that dna adduct levels are higher in those patients who started smoking earlier are logical and based on knowledge of the fate of carcinogendna adducts studied in human cells and tissues and in animal model systems 67 if dna adduct accumulation is the mechanism for the observed age at smoking initiation effect then it would be very important to know in which cels of the tissue the dna adducts have accumulated one might not ‘expect dna adducts to accumulate in surrogate populations of cells to the same extent as in lung tissue ‘the authors show an excellent correlation between smoking related aromatic dna adducts in target lung tissue and blood ‘mononuclear cells these results are consistent with the authors earlier work and suggest that such cells may serve as a useful surrogate forthe lung target tissue this i an important finding although the use of blood monocytes as a surrogate remains controversial it can be hypothesized that dna repair capacity and level of cytogenetic damage in the lymphocytes reflect processes occur fing in the target organ this hypothesis needs to be further evaluated if we are to develop quantitative risk assessment mod cls for lung cancer the conduct of largescale population stud jes requires us to utilize readily accessible noninvasive tissues ‘analysis of the dna adduct levels in blood mononuclear cells ‘in celation to age at initiation of smoking would have been imeresting and might contribute to a mechanistic understanding of the process for example does the relationship between age at initiation of smoking and level of

september 9 1982 to mr e j fackelman from k v mccaffrey re project aa with regards to your memo of september 2 let me say that while i dont disagree with the premise that imagery concepts are the most difficult to develop and refine on the down side i do feel that the upside of project aa has been completely overlooked 1 to put it in your words i view project aa as being corrective imagery and not compatible imagery if the designer name was calvin klein then i would say that aa is in a compatible image mode however yves saint laurant is a high fashion paris designer who is viewed as having distinctive sophisticated products which young adult female smokers want to be able to afford in their later years but cannot attain at this time ‘the strength that i see in project aa is a distinctive product coupled with a reinforcing image that could generate a very positive appeal this premise is based on womens return to femininity but i dont mean femininity in the traditional sense todays femininity includes not only physical attractiveness but also includes intelligence independence selfconfidence and the ability to successfully lead a full rich life the sexual  revolution is not part of todays 1824 year old woman they assume that all avenues of opportunity are open to them but they want to project themselves as attractive women not neuter gender 2 project aas main benefit to its target group is a cigarette that has a distinctively subtle taste not overpowering that is better than other brands on the market today the reason or support for why this cigarette is better is due to the designer name influence this influence causes expectations of a distinctive product that must be provided or consumers will feel they have been mislead as information a formal positioning statement will be issued the week of september 13 however the bottom line is a subtly distinctive product with a subtly distinctive image carrier 3 while it was known from the beginning that the odds of finding a solution to the 1824 year old corporate gap were minimal executive management felt that at least we might gain some usable consumer information therefore a rather rapid schedule was devised to not waste efforts if a solution did not appear quickly znee lnz0s,0

fractions prolonged pma treatment did not sustain bumetanidesensitive 2 cl1 na and 2 cl1 rb transport but did block stimulation of bumotanidesensitive transport by pmaor guanabent and elevation of pkc activity by pma and guanabenz in a particulate fraction cells treated with oka daic acid exhibited a staurosporine and bumetanidesensi tive 2 cl1 na and 2 cl rb uptake in cultured monolayers

secretory cells in a reconstituted tracheal epithelium pretreatment of transmonolayer cul ‘tures with pma diminished the stimulatory response to epinephrine these results indicate that in rabbit tracheal epithelial cells aadrenergic stimulation activated na2c1k at pkg is a critical effector in this process ‘aadrenergic receptors loop diuretics bumetanide protein phosphatase guanabenz epinephrine clonidine transmono layer cultures staurosporine protein kinase c ‘one mode of transporting the electrolytes na and cl ‘that is common to many cell types is cotransport of the electrolytes na and cl which is directly coupled to the inwardly directed na electrochemical gradient as the driving force for cl uptake an additional requirement for k is seen in some cells under specific stimulatory conditions such as for example vasopressin stimula tion of mouse medullary thick ascending limb 82 we have previously shown that nacl cotransport in hu man and rabbit tracheal epithelial cells is activated by aadrenergic agonists 15 and hyperosmotic challenge 16 the ca ionophore ionomycin mimics the response tooadrenergie stimulation other studies show second ary activation of cotransport in canine tracheal epithe lial cells which is mediated by agents that stimulate cal cl channels to induce cl secretion 10 11 these studies correlated stimulation of salt secretion by isopro terenol atp and utp to the equilibrium level of saturable basolateral bumetanidebinding sites the caa8 finding of increased bumetanide binding with induction of cl secretion was interpreted as upregulation of cotransport in cl secretory cells our finding of direct activation of cotransport by a adenosine 35eyclic monophosphate campindepen dent mechanism led to detailed studies of the intracel lular signaling of the aadrenergic stimulation the studies first focused on effectors involved in cadependent mecha nisms for signal transduction the results demonstrate aadrenergic activation of phosphatidylinositol 45 bisphosphate ptdins45pzspecific phospholipase c with subsequent hydrolysis of ptdine45p to two intracellular second messengers inositol phosphate 17 and diacylglycerol 18 the transient nature of mediator release within a time frame that coincides with cotransporter activation suggested a link between ca and diacylglycerol these two intracellular media tors are activators for some isotypes of protein kinase c pkc ref 31 pkc subsumes a family of at least 10 subtypes some of which require ca for activation 26 31 pkc has been linked to the regulation of other electrolyte trans porters including cation and anion exchangers that operate during cell volume regulation salt absorption and ph regulation and ion channels that are required for secretion in particular an apical cl channel 2 46 ‘a useful tool in identifying and characterizing pkc regulation is phorbol 12myristate 13acetate pma phorbol ester that activates pkc 31 the effects pma often show a time dependence that is interpreted as resulting from activation early or downregulation cate of pkc for example with some ion exchangers such as nah or cvhco of thyroid and vero cells respectively shortterm treatment with pma acti vates ion exchange whereas longterm treatment with pma which chronically activates pkc fails to alter electrolyte transport through ion exchangers 22 34 in the latter instance chronic activation of pkc leads ‘to downregulation due to increased sensitivity to prote lysis 81 shortterm pma treatment can induce opposing responses as seen in intestinal and renal epithelial cells 35 in these cells neh exchangers found on apical membranes are inhibited by pma which produces an opposite effect of stimulation on cation exchangers in the basolateral surface pma also influences the activity of naclk eotrans porters in epithelial and nonepithelial cells fibro blasts 27 30 endothelial cells 26 and osteoblasts 88 express a cotransporter that is sensitive to pma ‘thus suggesting regulation through pkc phorbol ester stimulated cotransporters of cell lines derived from epithelia such as colonic ht29 1 and t84 cells 12 036561496 500 copyright © 1996 the

reflected not only in the total numberof ingested targets but also in the percentage of pmn participating in the phagocytic process 12 presum ably this regulation of ingestion acts to limit the damsging products of pmn activation such as toxic oxygen metabolites and sereted lysosomal products tothe ste of inflammation ‘we and others have found that pmn can recruit several istnet molecular mechanisms for phagocytosisin response to inflammatory signals which may be regulated further by the specific opsonin igg cab c3 and c3 and opsonin recep torferil feriit cr and cr3 engaged 19 in addition ‘monocytes and macrophages employ quite different molecular rechanisms for phagocytosis from those employed by pmn ‘even when the same opsonin or opsonin receptor is involved 1 10 in this manner at inflammatory sites where pmn and macrophages encounter proinflammatory cytokines interfr ‘ons interleukins chemotactic peptides and components of ion isnot only augmented but ‘the molecular mechanism involved in phagocytosis may be alteced asan example we have shown recently that ingestion of igg opsonized targets by nonstimulated pmn is not depe dent upon protein kinase cpkc activation however when pmn are simulated with tumor necrosis factor tnf2 not only is ingestion ofthe iggopsonized targets markedly increased but pkc translocation is also greatly augmented over the minimal amount observed with either igg or tnf« alone 11 this synergism inactivation of pkc is essential for the increased ingestion by pmn exposed to tnfa 11 the jmportance ofthese dat tohost defense is demonstrated by the fact that pmn from patients with chronic granulomatous dis case cgd which lack the ability to generate a respiratory ‘bust s well as pmn from patients with paroxysmal nocturnal

2acetylaminofluorene 2aaf followed by tumor promotion using dietary phenobarbital pb ex posure animals receiving only 2aaf or pb do not possess this new aldehyde dehydrogenase activity the phenotype is characterized by the appearance of a new cytosolic isozyme kinetcally electrophoretically and immumochemically distinct from the normal liver aldehyde dehydrogenase iso zymes and from aldchyde dehydrogenases inducible in 2aapinduced hepatomas the new isozyme is naddepen ‘ent dislfiramsenstive and crossreacts with antiserum to a normal liver aldehyde dehydrogenase inducible in several lines of rats by pb however the population of animals used inthis study has been shown previously to be nonresponsive to aldehyde dehydrogenase induction by dietary pb since no animals receiving only pb express this new isozyme the ar cinogen must play a significant role in its induction more ‘over that not all animals receiving carcinogen and promoter possess the phenotype suggests this carcinogeapromoterin eraction has a genetic basis introduction work in our laboratory is directed toward elucidating the ‘mechanisms underlying the expression of a unique aldehyde dehydrogenase phenotype aldehydenadp oxidoreduc tase ec 1213 and 131 in hepatomas induced in ‘spraguedawley rats by 2acetylaminofluorene 2aaf 15 the phenotype is characterized by an increase in total aldehyde dehydrogenase activity due to the appearance of several cytosolic isozymes not present in normal live the tumor isozymes are very active with aromatic aldehyde substrates and nadp as coenzyme and have electrophoretic obits isocletrie points and immunochemical properties distinct from those of normal liver aldehyde dehydrogenases 25 the tumor phenotype is not due to reexpression of fetal aldehyde dehydrogenase activity 4 to date we have observed no significant changes in aldehyde dehydrogenase activity in normal liver during 2aafinduced hepatocarcino genesis prior to the appearance of the

me c h goldsmith janvary 26 1970 f e resnik ftc gas phase letter in reference to the fic gas phase letter of january 9 1970 i would like to make the following coments the pic letter states the term gas phase as though it 9 a single component which can be readily measured in the cigarette smoke particulate matter is defined as that material from cigarette smoke which is collected on  cambridge filter pad and the gas phase s defined as that material which pasees ti the cambridge filter pad since the particulate matter is collected on a canbridge pad it can readily be weighed and thus a single value determined for a cigarette brand this is rot the case for gas phase since there is no established means for collecting and determining a single value for this phase of cigarette smoke the gas phase of cigarette smoke is composed of over 90 air carbon dioxide carbon monoxide and water ‘therefore to develop methods for determining g28 phase ac defined as that material passing through a cambridge filter pad would be of little significance we need to ack the ptc what they mean vith regard to their letter using the phrase gas phase of cigarette exoke for your additional inforvation i am attaching an article published by liggett  myers in 1965 in which table 2 gives come idea of the distribution and composition of the gas phase of cigarette smoke with regerd to the ftcs request that we list all varieties of cigarettos vhich reduce or in any vay affect the gas phase of cigarette smoke we should inform them that all our cigarette brands reduce some components of the gas phase of cizerette emoke an article published by liggett  myers thie onth shows that hcn is reduced by an ordinary ca filter this 10 illustrated in table 1 of the attached article with regard to our advertisements for multifilter there are numerous articles in the literature which show selected removal of various gas phase components by the use of a charcoal filter we should be able to readily cubotantiate our claims from the literature without any actual documentation of our laboratory results or methodology there ara many questions to be resolved regarding the methodology to ba used for the analyeis of spreific components in the gas phase of cigarette smoke in y opinion the analyte of gas phase components is going to be considerably more difficult than the analysis of the particulate matter of cigarette umoke for one reason total particulate matter io generally present in milligram amounts per cigarette whereas specific gee phase componente are present in microgram enounts per cigarette or 1000 tines less than total particulate matter s6tszezu0 twill be happy to discu this subject with you at your convenience ferael pof wanna,0

interoffice memorandum subject lung weight data date february 11 1987 to dr g t burger from c r e coggins attached to this note are the data from battelle pacific northwest laboratory bpnwl on lung weights giving absolute data and the ratios of tung weight to brain weight and to body weight note that there are only 15 observations for each mean cf up to 30 for the inhouse study the data could be interpreted as showing an increase in the mean tung weight of the rhd group and some of the unpublished work that i am aware of would agree with such an interpretation i consider that we should use the spare lungs originally destined for the measurement of biochemical endpoints to determine whether or not the increased weights are due to increased fluid content or whether the lungs are indeed heavier the measurement of a dry weight either by ashing or by a microwave technique is of course a destructive procedure however i do not think that the lungs can be usefully employed in any other way because they were not inflated before being frozen i recommend asking arnold mosberg to determine whether or not bpnwl could determine wet and dry weights on the lungs and to obtain a cost estimate for the work lg coppa os ins crec tml hayes ayres debethizy doolittle hayes mosberg peper apeors 4ecd feb1 1987 tm a  g a,0

title tobacco restriction today what tomorrow byline joe hawkins credit special to the banner est pages 2  010596 nshv22827 nashville banner nshv section news page al3 copyright 1996 column community voices there is an issue currently facing tennesseans and their agricultural heritage that is much more complex than would be realized at first glance the issue is that of regulatory jurisdiction of tobaccorelated products for those tennesseans not involved in agriculture production or nontobacce users the issue vould seem even more insignificant than however this is an issue of tremendous importance to last year the us food and drug administration fda announced a farreaching plan to exercise regulatory control over the marketing and sale of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco the foundation for this action is based on the fda assumption that tobacco products are a delivery device of nicotine two major concerns arise from this regulatory initiative while the antitobacco forces of todays society argue that the tobacco issue should be addressed without regard to economics it is unrealistic to do so economics cannot be disregarded for it is the very purpose of the production process tobacco producers do not grow tebacco to create a ‘‘drug delivery system tebacco producers grow tobacco in order to pay the bills that in turn help maintain other business activity production has through the years passed on a strong work ethic an ability to provide for a family on limited production resources land significant economic benefit to the local state and federal tax revenue it has clothed fed and educated a significant number of tennesseans it is interesting to note that tennessee passed a temporary tax in 1925 on tobacco products to fund education that tax was made permanent in 1927 and in 1994 resulted in an excess of 84 million for education no other product can compete with that contribution just as no other product can offer the return on investment to the producer if the demand for any product provided the production incentive of tobacco producers would respond alternative crops are often suggested however if a major shift to any other production was successful without major marketing network changes for that production chaos and bankruptcy would be the result for many aside from economics another major concern arises from this fda ti16860058,9

reliability of self reporting questionnaires for determining passive exposure to cigarette smoke in office environments a white paper by david a sterling demetrios j moschandreas increased amount of publications and advocate advertising on the health effects of smoking has led to the growing concern of nonsmokers on potential effects of passive exposure to cigarette smoke to assess this potential exposure researchers have used several scientific instruments prevalent ‘among them are individual self reporting or interview questionnaires asking people how many cigarettes they smoke or nonsmokers how many cigarettes are smoked near them may seem a reasonable approach however discrepancies between estimated consumption through questionnaire surveys and actual number consumed have been reported around 30 percent » it is suspected that a large portion of the discrepancy is due to the tendency of respondents to systematically underreport benavidr or events which may be perceived as undesirable although it has not been investigated there may also be a tendency of nonsmokers to overreport their perceived exposure to cigarette smoke correction factors have been developed and used on smoking data to approximate actual rates if nonsmokers also show a systematic reporting bias t may be possible to develope another set of such correction factors there is a need for focused research to determine the reliability of using questionnaires for assessing passive exposure to cigarette smoke iitri proposes an investigation to assess the reliability of self reporting ques tionnaires specifically we will address questionnaires on smoking behavior which are typically used in indoor air quality studies for assessing possible exposure to cigarette smoke of non smokers in public environments the investigation will attempt to determine the variation around a “true number of reported cigarettes consumed by smokers and reported exposed to by nonsmokers zoesovos ut research institute 1,6

richard j sanderson kathleen rulon elly g groeneboer anp david w talmage “from the department of microbiology and the webb waring lung institute university of colorado health sciences center ‘denver

with an electronic particle counting and sizing apparatus coulter counter and channelizer mitogenesis as determined by increase in cell number correlated well with the timeintegrated uptake of tritiated thymidine it was found that costim ulator was highly mitogenic to the lectininduced blasts and that the cells appearing in response to it were uni formly large costimulator blasts furthermore the eventual increase in cell number was proportional to the costimulator concentration at least for the concentra tions cell numbers and incubation times examined this relatively simple assay that uses the coulter counter and channelizer is therefore capable of substituting for serial measurements of tritiated thymidine uptake and yields additional information on the volume spectra of responding cells as well as forming the basis for assay ing costimulator activity ‘the costimulator blasts were found to be capable of killing a wide variety of allogenele as well as syngeneic

hhuman ovarian carcinoma cells is sufficient to reduce tumor response in vivo the ddp sensitivity of these cells can be enhanced by activation of the epidermal growth factor and pro ‘ein kinase c

respectively both agents also produced sensitization in an 11fold ddpre sistant 2008 subline neither bombesin nor tnfa changed the accumulation of ddp glutathione content or glutathiones transferase activity in 2008 cells however a 2h exposure to ‘oth bombesin and tnfa was suficent to increase 2008 clon ing efficiency by up to 2601 sdfold and 22201 sd fold and it increased average colony size by 135201 sd fold and 15501 sdfol respectively bombesin increased intracellular free calcium and this was blocked by the bombe sin receptorspecific antagonist sc196 demonstrating that 2008 cells have functional bombesin receptors these results indicate that bombesin and tnfa can enhance sensitivity to ddp in both ddp sensitive and resistant variants of a human ‘ovarian carcinoma and that both

treatment with peritoneal dialysis both are indistinguishable from those in normal vol teers 9 based on the fact that renal failure is aecompanied by clevated plasma concentrations of several hormones that act vate adenylate cyclase pth norepinephrine glucagon and adh 113 it was postulated that an increase in relative ionic chloride permeability might not be confined to the red cell but rather might represent a more global change in membrane permeability in chronic renal failure since intracellular chio fide activity is at or above electrochemical equilibrium in diverse issues 1 7 8 14 1s a selective increase in rel ionic chloride permeability would depolarize cells 1 3 5 if such were the case the resultant perturbations in cell function thats transport and electrical signaling could be responsible at least in part for a number of systemic manifestations of renal failure ‘the present studies were designed to determine whether an increase in membrane ionic chloride permeability is confined 10 human red cell membranes or whether such an increase occurs in other cells in renal fulure the 75 nephrectomized rat was used as a model of renal failure these studies demonstrate that renal failure in the rat is accompanied by increases in renal cortical camp concentration and relative ionic chloride perme ability of renal cortical brush border membranes of note these changes were not confined to renal cortical membranes as io the human 9 red blood cell camp concentrations and the ‘onic chioride permeability of rbc membranes were signfi cantly increased in renal failure in the rat the demonstration of qualitatively similar findings in membranes of both potarized and nonpolarized cells suggests that membrane ionic perme ability may be significantly altered in a number of

hipdb binding in intact cells is pre dominantly to membraneassociated enzyme the ca’ ionophore ionomycin and two other camobilizing hormones bradykinin and histamine mimic the effects of carbachol furthermore when hormonesensitive ca stores are depleted by prior agonist treatment the carbacholinduced increases in intracellular ca and hipdb binding are completely blocked under these conditions

the increase in hjpdb binding is max imal furthermore hjpdb binding has returned to control levels when dag concentrations are maxi mally elevated these data suggest that hormonestim ulated increases in cytoplasmic ca cause a marked and rapid redistribution of protein kinase c which recedes uny significant increase in dag our findings also demonstrate that hjpdb binding to intact cells may be a

to recd mays 182 ic interoffice memorandum tobacco cost reduction by modification date may 4 1982 of g13 blends dr j p dickerson from d p johnson a number of proposals have been made in previous memoranda for reducing rjr tobacco costs without sacrificing product quality ‘among these is a proposal to reduce the burley content of our blends since burley is the most expensive primary tobacco used to help accomplish this i recommend that consideration be given to changing the ratio of fluecured to burley in our g13 blends at present most of these blends contain three parts burley to one part fluecured since all of our cigarette blends contain 12 or more g13 this means that a minimum of about 37 of our burley is puffed although puffed burley retains much of its  normal smoking character it nevertheless is altered and its impact is reduced this coupled with the fact that about 40 of our burley also is denicotinized probably demands a higher percentage of burley in our blends to achieve the desired flavor level two factors contributed to the initial decision to adopt a high burley blend for puffing first puffing imparts a significantly lighter color to tobacco and puffed fluecured pecially conspicuous in the cigarette filler thus burley with its naturally dark color was chosen and initially it was the only type puffed secondly fluecured tobacco retains considerably higher levels of residual freon than cased burley and additional information was needed on the rate of dissipation of freon and its fate during the burning process ‘this question has since been answered and concern for both factors has abated there fore if the burley to fluecured ratio in the g13 blends could be changed to a high level of fluecured and a low level of burley perhaps a reduction in total burley could be made and an overall cost reduction realized recently a high fluecuredlow burley g13 blend has been adopted for the ultra low tar brands because of the high levels of g13 in these products however these brands represent a relatively small percentage of our total production a secondary but very important benefit to be gained by reversing the tobacco ratio is improved product uniformity g13 is com bined with the remainder of the blend in the top dressing drum and in spite of manufacturings best efforts uniform blending is not always achieved bege lzeos iri form 2422rev 770,0

to killing by the fibrotropic strain of minute virus of mice lpacvovirus mvmp became sensitive to mvm when transformed by polyomay rus this sensitization did ‘nat involve an inerease in the pereentage of cells which synthesized viral capsid antigens or in the percentage of cells which produced infectious virus the addition of antimvm antiserum to the growth medium of ‘mvmginfected cells had only a small effect on theic survival rates indicating that the majority of the killing ifec of mvm occurs in a single cycle of infection the data indicate that cell killing by mvm is independent ‘of infectious virus production and thus support the notion that the preferential cytolytic effect is affected by ‘ral eylotoxic gene products which accumulate to intolerable levels in transformed cells but not in normal ones fi iy using cells transformed with polyom as and genomic and subgenomic clones of polyomavirus we showed that the extent of sensitization to killing by mvm depended on the transforming agent used certain parvoviruses possess the intriguing capability to destroy oncogenically transformed cells selectively in cule ture while having litle or no effect on the viability of the parental untransformed cells this preferential toxicity to transformed cells may account forthe inhibition of intuced tumorigenesis oncosuppression reported to occur in vivo 26 8 11 22 2527 a variety of ells have been used to study the preferential killing effect of autonomous parvoviruses these include tmouse 313 eels 1315 several at lroblast cel ines 13 and human rbroblasis and epithelial cells 34 a variety of transforming agents have also been used including simian virus 40 1 4 10 14 13 avian erythroblestosis vins 3 human rasoncogene 18 and radiation and chemical ca inogens 14 these studies show that the killing efect of transformed cells is dependent neither on the type of cell for on the transforming agent used and i the preferential killing of transformed cells is correlated with clevated expression of the viral genome in this study we invest faled the question of whether the production of infectious virus was required forthe selective iling effect of minute virus of mice mvm “the fischer rat embryo fibroblast cell line f11 chosen for this study is subject to astringent contact inhibition its anchorageindependent grovih i extremely low and it has  very typieal broblastc appearance these properties allow relatively easy isolation of cells with transformed pheno types 2 the flll and fl1uvpy polyomavirustrans formed f1l1 cell lines used in this study were obtained from t benjamin additional polyomavirusransformed cell lines established in our laboratory by using the method of fluck and benjamin 7 were also examined and yielded essentially identical results ll the transformed cell lines wwere showin to express the polyomavirus middlet antigen ‘the fii1ecllline was useful fortis study because of is exceptionally tight resistance to killing by the flrotropic  corresponiting author 488 strain of mvm mvmp mymp iofection caused a transient and slight cytopathic effect at days 1 and 2 after which the culture recovered and a normal growth rate was resumed in contrast the polyomavirusetransformed deriv ative cell lines were destroyed completely by mvmp infection within 24 h fig 1 the total yield of infectious virus produced in polyomavirustransformed cells was 10° to 10fold higher than that produced in similarly infected ‘untransformed cell lines table 1 this difference range in virus yield is comparable with those of other permissive restrictive systems for mvm 9 20 21 24 a subline of mouse lcells a9 which is used as a standard permissive cell line for mvmp was also included in all our experi ments for comparison table 1 shows that virus production in a9 cells was only slightly lower than in f111py cells to investigate the relationship between the killing effect and virus production cell killing during a single cycle of infection was quantitated by using an infectious center lassay this assay was performed as follows at 4 h post fection the cells were washed twice with phosphatebuffered saline to remove unattached and unabsorbed virus trypsinized suspended in dulbecco modified eagle medium containing 35 mm hepes n2hydroxyethylpiperazinen 2ethanesulfonic acid buller ph 73 supplemented with 10 fetal

laboratories plaques were counted 20 later these assays consistently showed that the mvmp permissive fraction in f111 cells was nearly identical to that found in the polyomavirus transfor mmants table

date name addrese address dear name the occupational safety and health administration osha is currently considering workplace smoking regulations that if enacted would virtually ban smoking at all indoor worksites  including philip morris usa under this proposal employers would only be able to accommodate smokers if they constructed separate smoking rooms with completely separate ventilation systems advocates of these new rules are well aware that most employers cannot afford to provide separately ventilated smoking rooms and that the proposed rules actually constitute a nationwide workplace smoking ban even more troubling oshas definition of workplace is so broad it encompasses almost any indoor location where an employee is present  including your own home if you employ a plumber to fix your sink other workplaces where smoking would be banned include all restaurants bars hotel rooms private offices and company vehicles smoking would not even be allowed in a room rented for a private party or function fortunately there is still an opportunity to amend or even prevent the proposed workplace smoking rules from now until august 13 osha will accept public comment on the workplace smoking ban to have your comments entered into the official osea file on this issue please follow these three simple steps 1 take a few minutes to write a brief letter telling osha that designated smoking areas are preferable to the severe restrictions now being considered 2 make three copies of your letter this is to comply with federal law 3 put your original letter along with the three copies inside one envelope and mail to osha docket docket no h122 4660828202,0

between two alternate structural formst karen a lecuyer and donald m crothers department of chemistry yale university new haven connecticut 06511 received november 12 1992 revised manuscript received february 10 1993 apstract we have used a combination of physical and motecular biological techniques to examine the structure of leptomonas collosoma spliced leader rna we confirm the general features of the previously proposed structure for the 3’ half of the rna in which a singlestranded region is flanked by two stem loops however we find that the 5’ half of the rna which contains the spice site has two competing secondary structures which differ only slightly in stability and which can interconvert on a fast 1 s time scale in the favored conformation a stable hairpin helix is augmented by conserved complementarity between the splice site and the s’end ofthe sl rna this putative helix has anomalous nuclease sensitivity and thermal stability features suggesting that itis probably coupled by unknown tert other nucleotides in the 5 halfmolecule the structure offers intriguing parallels with rnarna 5301 interactions in the mammalian splicing system premrna splicing sa processby which anintron sexcised and the exons are then ligated reviews padgett etal 1986 maniatis and reed 1987 intermediates in the cs splicing reaction have been well characterized the trans splicing reaction of

boothroyd 1986 in trypanosomes all of themature mrnas contain the spliced leader at their ends a trans spliced leader is also found in a small pereentage of nematode mrnas kraus  hirsh 1987 blumenthal  ‘thomas 1988 ‘the proposed secondary structure for the kinetoplastid spliced leader sl rnas bruzik et al 1988 was based upon relative free energies predicted by the fold program zuker 1989 and upon conservation ofthe folding pattern for several sl rnas this structural conservation among the trypanosomatid sl rnas is striking due tothe lack of length and sequence homology ouside ofthe spliced leader exon portion of the molecule the proposed secondary structure contains three stem loops the second and third of which flank a singlestranded region which has the sequence ofa binding ste for sm

independenceof splicing the trans spliced leader to an adenovirus exon in cis has also been demonstrated using uldepleted hela cell extracts bruzik  steitz 1990 this result led to the proposal that he

features of the proposed model bruzik et al 1988 primarily by determining the stability and binding kinetics of dna oligonucleotides hybridized to the putatively singlestranded regions which ae predicted by the model this approach yielded the predicted results for the 3 but not the 5’ half of the molecule we also examined the thermal unfolding equilibria and kinetics for the molecule ‘using the temperaturejump tjump technique in which ‘thesampleis rapidly heated and the optical changeis measured asa function of time we found a lowtemperature thermal transition which could not be accounted for by unfolding of ihelies in the model of bruzik et al 1988 subsequent experiments localized this effect to the 5’half of the molecule we then employed mutagenesis and polyacrylamide gel clectrophoresis methods such as ribonuclease mapping douth waite  garrett 1981 celander  cech 1990 and base rmodificationinterference experiments peattie 1979 conway  wickens 1989 weeks et al 1990 to probe the structure ofthe s‘halfof leptomonascollosomaslrna we propose anew structure in which a stable hairpin helix is augumented by pairing of the 5’ end of the sl rna with the spice site ‘the hairpin helix has a measured ty about 6 °c higher than the analogous helix proposed by broziketal 1988 however the putative splice site helix bas unusual properties including ‘anomalously small thermal stability changes upon mutation singlestrand nuclease sensitivity a the splicesiteand apparent tertiary interactions with additional nucteotides in the 5 half of the slrna we speculate that

experimentally infected asymptomatic sheep with latent infections donna m lagarias and kathryn radke department of avian sciences university of california davis california 95616 received 14 september 1984accepted 8 february 1989 infection by bovine jeukemia virus blv is characterized by a long latency period after which some individuals develop bcell mors the behavior of bl and related retroviruses during the latency period detween initial infection and subsequent tumorigenesis is poorly understood we used in situ hybridization to detect blv transcripts in individual peripheral bloed mononuclear cells from experimentally infected ‘asymptomatic sheep with latent infections viral rna was not found in most peripheral blood cells that had been isolated as rapidly as possible from circulating blood but it was present in rare cells bly rna transcripts increased in a biphasic manner within a few hours after the blood cells were placed in culture exposure to fetal bovine serum was identified as the principal cause of this transcriptional activation which ‘occurred in fewer than 1 in 1000 cells agents knovn to activate immune cells polyclonally caused a further increase inthe numberof cells containing bly rna within §h in some cases the numbers of vial transcripts within individual cells also increased thus bly is not detectably expressed io most resting lymphocytes ‘ireulating in the blood but its transcription is activated by components of fetal bovine serum and can be augmented by molecules that mine activation of immune cells this activation which might occur in lymphoid ussue during an imouune response may lead to the synthesis of viral regulatory proteins that are thought o initiate tumorigenesis through host cell genes bovine leukemia virus bly human tcell leukemia virus types i and il htlvi and htlvli respectively and human immunodeficiency virus hiv ate all retrovi rises that replicate in cells of the immune system infection by these viruses is followed by a long latency period and a certain proportion of infected individuals then rapidly prog ress to terminal disease because these viruses integrate essentially at random into the host genome and do not contain cellderived oncogenes it is thought that the viral gene products themselves lead to development of disease ‘the genomes of blv htly and hiv encode cransacting factors that regulate viral transcription but litle is known about how viral transcripts that encode these regulatory proteins are initially induced for hiv recent evidence ‘suggests that immune responses to unrelated antigens trigger virus replication and contribute o disease progression re viewed in reference 15 bly htlyi and htlvt are tumorigenic retroviruses that cause leukemia and lymphoma reviewed in references 4 ‘and 53 and are distinet from hiv a lentivirus that causes fatal immunodeficiency and neuropathy of the central ner ‘vous system reviewed in reference 15 blv and htlvi share numerous features of infection and pathology they also have similar genomic structures 43 and use common ‘strategies for gene expression the 3” ends ofthe genomes of htlv and bly contain the x sequences encoding a set of novel proteins 30 39 41 45 that are necessary for ecient transcription from the viral promoter 7 11 40 and that determine the relative proportions of spliced and unspliced transcripts 12 25 27 aside from host range a notable difference between the two viruses is that blv infection is associated with malignancy of b cells whereas htlv affects t cell ‘corresponding author ‘tumor cells contain at least part of one provirus but the viral genome is not detectably expressed 16 28 which suggests that viral gene products are not necessary 10 maintain the transformed state the x proteins encoded by the virus may set in motion a series of events leading 10 secondary genetic changes that result in malignant transfor mation 54 its important for two reasons to know where ‘and under what conditions viral genes are expressed before tumor development begins  intermittent production and spread of the virus would favor transformation simply by increasing the population of cells at risk for such a genetic change i it is possible that the xencoded proteins tax and rex could be produced from a subgenomic message without production of virions and that tax itself is responsi ble for changes in cells that could lead to uncontrolled srowth 19 26 33 blvspecific rnas have not previously been detected in rna extracted from populations of monontclear cells newly

identical in epoproducing and noaepoproducing cells transcrip tion of reporter genes containing the epo gene enhancer is induced by hypoxia in nonepoproducing cells and mutations hat eliminate hif1 binding eliminate inducibility these results provide evidence that hifl and lis recogaltion se quence are common components of a general mammalian cellular response to hypoxia calls sense and respond to extracellular and intracellular stimli © maintain homeostasis and hypoxia is one of the ‘most fundamental of all environmental stimuli a major physiologic mechanism by which mammals respond to tissue hypoxia is through stimulation of erythropoiesis resulting in fan increased blood oycarrying capacity erythropoietin epo the primary humoral regulator of mammalian eryth topoiesis epo rna

production of epo and subsequent increase in erythropoiesis thus provide a major homeostatic mecha nism for maintaining issue oxygenation ‘a major research objective in our laboratory has been to identify the cisacting dna sequences and transacting pro tein factors that regulate hypoxiainducible human epo gene expression liverspecific dnase hypersensitive sites have been identified in the

treatment of hep3b cells with cycloheximide inhibited the hypoxic induc tion of both epo rna 7 and hif1 dna binding acuvity 9 these results provided further evidence for the impor ance of hif1 in epo

bactys igdvstrial hygiene and toxicology vol3a ch07202 the fundamentais be 22 the fundamentals behind the tlvs the acgih tlvs and most other oels are limits that refer to airborne concentrations of substances and represent conditions under which it is believed that nearly all workers may be repeatedly exposed dayafterday without adverse health effects 4 acgih 1992 it is important to recognize that unlike some exposure limits for ambient air pollutants contaminated water or food additives set by other professional groups or regulatory agencies exposure to the tlv will not necessarily prevent discomfort or injury for everyone who is exposed 7 adkins et al 1990 the acgih recognized long ago that because of the wide range in individual susceptibility a small percentage of workers may experience discomfort from some substances at concentrations at or below the threshold limit and that a smaller percentage may be affected more seriously by aggravation of a preexisting condition or by development of an occupational illness 47 cooper 1973 140 omenn 1982 4 acgih 1992 this is clearly stated in the introduction to the acgihs annual booklet “threshold limit values for chemical substances and physical agents and biological exposure indices 4 acgih 1992  this limitation although perhaps less than ideal has been considered a practical one since airborne concentrations so low as to protect hypersusceptibles have traditionally been judged infeasible due to either engineering or economic limitations this shortcoming in the tlvs has until the past 4 years not been considered a serious one if society wishes to significantly reduce workplace exposures by using engineering controls and personal protective equipment it is now possible to do so in light of the dramatic improvements of the past 10 years in our analytical capabilities personal monitoringsampling devices biological monitoring techniques and the use of robots as a plausible engineering control we are now technologically able to consider more stringent occupational exposure limits whether we are willing to invest the financial resources needed to control workplace exposure to much lower levels or whether it makes good economic sense to do so is not yet known 222 us epa sab 1990 threshold limit values like most other oels used in other countries are based on the best available information from industrial experience experimental human and animal studies and when possible from a combination of the three 196 smith and olishifski 1988 4 acgih 1992 the rationale for each of the values differs from substance to substance for example protection against impairment of health may be a guiding factor for some whereas reasonable freedom from irritation narcosis nuisance or other forms of stress may form the basis for others the age and completeness of the information available for establishing most occupational exposure limits also varies from substance to substance consequently the precision of each particular tlv is subject to variation the most recent tlv and its documentation should always be consulted in order to evaluate the quality of the data upon which that value was set the background information and rationale for each tlv is published periodically in the documentation of the threshold limit values acgih 1989 some type of documentation is ‘occasionally available for oels set in other countries the rationale or documentation for a particular oel should always be consulted before interpreting or adjusting an exposure limit as well as the specific data considered in establishing it 4 acgih 1992 even though all of the publications that contain oels emphasize that they were intended for use only in establishing safe levels of exposure for persons in the workplace they have been used at times in other situations itis for this reason that all exposure limits should be interpreted and applied only by someone knowledgeable of industrial hygiene and toxicology the tlv committee did not intend that they be used or modified for use 2073095202 john wiley  sons inc 1998 all rights reserved  a,6

estigators studying the biologic effects of tobacco smoking in almost all cases prior to the introduction of gas chroma ‘ographic gc techniques nicotine had to be extracted from ological fluids by relatively complex procedure which were ‘less than fully quantitative futhermore the final extract ‘represented a complex mixture of organic compounds that ‘ave many peaks in the gas chromatogram which were difficult o interpret ‘this complexity was reduced substantially bythe intro duction of a nitrogensensitive detector into the gc procedure as the nitrogensensitive detector does not respond to organic compounds containing only c h and o atoms it yields a relatively simple gc spectrum compared to flame ionization ‘detectors fid the higher sensitivity of the nitrogensensitive ‘detector has made it easier to analyze solutions where nicotine ‘apresent in minute concentrations for example in te blood ‘of human smokers on the other hand the increased sen sitivity introduced by these techniques makes it more difficult ‘to achieve an acceptable level of reproducibility of the ex ‘taction and determination procedures partiularly for sam les that contain a low concentration of
